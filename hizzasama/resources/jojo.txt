This old man is familiar to us.
Well, at least his bearing and scar should be.
Nice to see you again, Speedwagon.
I hear you're an oil tycoon in America now.
That's an exaggeration.
You look as young as ever, Straizo.
Hamon energy is life energy. I must say I envy you.
49 years after Jonathan's death, a new age has arrived.
They set off for Mexico to see something.
That something was discovered by
That something was a secret known only to those select few.
When you witness this, I think, no, I am sure you'll feel a chill.
It's frightful enough to make your hair stand on end.
It's even worse than the terror we faced
This place is tremendous.
This is why I summoned you.
I-It's...
...the mask!
There are so many of them!
New York, 1938
It was the fall of 1938.
I was out looking for a mark as usual.
You must be kidding!
You've never heard of this beverage?
By your accent, I'd say you're from England. Tourist?
Oh? You just moved here, eh?
Anyhow, if you want a drink, pay me.
Hey, friend! He took your wallet! After him!
What a sucker! Piece of cake!
Hey, Smokey. Looks like I finally caught you red-handed!
You worthless street scum!
I'll make sure they lock you up for 20 years!
Take it easy! I only pinched a wallet!
I hate all of your bottom-feeding kind!
But I'm a nice guy.
Bring me twenty dollars every week.
Plus half of what you steal.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's the stooge who got robbed.
I'm keeping your wallet as evidence.
Well, how should I put this? Let's see...
That wallet was actually a gift to him, officer.
The 195 cm giant of an Englishman was covering up for me!
So I need you to let go of the wallet and the boy.
What's that?
Like I said, it was a gift.
He's a close friend of mine.
Please let him go.
A close friend?
Tell me your close friend's name.
Don't lie to me!
You bonehead!
I'm curious.
I don't understand why you did that.
What was the purpose behind it?
There's no purpose! I do what I feel like, dimwit!
If someone wipes a booger on your right cheek, then--
You picked the wrong man to mess with, pig!
Y-You're resisting arrest!
Shoot me! But I'm warning you!
When you pull the trigger, I'll break your finger like a match!
Not from over there! I'll blow your brains out!
Suddenly, it seemed to me like his body was glowing.
It was like magic.
I lost my temper again!
N-Now I'm in trouble.
G-Granny Erina will be furious!
W-What is this guy?
He beats up cops and then worries
So, Mr. Pickpocket, shall we high-tail it?
He didn't know how he launched the bottle cap with such force.
He said he could always do it.
His grandpa died young, but he could do the same thing.
His dad died in the War, but had no such talents.
He didn't have a mom, either.
I owe you big time.
My name's Smokey. What's yours?
Joestar.
Joseph Joestar.
Battle Tendency
Chapter 10: JoJo in New York
You can call me JoJo.
What is this? Who is the man in that pillar?
It's not a carving.
He has amino acids. He has cells.
And though faint, he has body heat and a pulse.
This man is alive!
Straizo, what is he exactly? How long has he been here?
What are the masks for? Why is he here?
None of that matters! We have one purpose here!
I called you so that you could destroy him utterly
What of Joseph Joestar?
How is the young man doing?
I hear he used Hamon to save your life once.
Why bring JoJo up now?
I believe it was back when he was 13 years old.
Yes, some men hijacked your plane so that they could ransom you.
Hey, kid! You can't stay back here. Get up front!
You're hijacking Speedwagon, right?
I'm just a bystander.
I'm just going to read my comic. You go do your business.
Don't give me any lip, punk!
JoJo!
T-This is bad.
That suit were a gift from Erina. That'll set him off for sure!
Take it easy, JoJo!
You guys knew the plane might crash if you hijacked it, right?
Was that Hamon?
T-The kid is crazy! We're gonna crash!
Grab the yoke!
I can't fly!
Wrap the pilot in this! We're jumping!
You never think things through!
I do think.
You're my only family, after all.
He looks just like his grandfather, but he's far from a gentleman.
That was when I discovered that Joseph could use Hamon.
So he inherited Hamon breathing from his grandfather Jonathan.
That's right.
But why bring that up now?
W-What the devil?
I just killed these men.
And when you die...
...Jonathan's grandson will feel grief and anger.
He will grow to hate me.
S-Straizo!
Straizo...
A-Are you mad?!
Quite the opposite. My thinking is very clear.
I chose the path of Hamon in order to forge my body.
But as I trained, the aging of my body became painfully clear to me.
Hamon gives only the slightest edge over ordinary people.
Its practice cannot prevent the aging process.
In the battle all those years ago, I secretly admired Dio.
He was powerful, beautiful and immortal.
I coveted the power of the mask.
I didn't care who got in the way!
Y-You've become twisted, Straizo.
Your blood will now grant me immortality.
With you gone, only Erina and
Once I am rid of them, I'll take my time
Y-You mustn't!
T-There are terrible things we don't yet know!
Eri...na...
Jo...Jo...
Why don't you look where you're going, dolt?!
Go find a dog to lick your butt clean!
Now get out of the way, you...
Hello! What was that? Slow down!
Say that again so that I can understand your gibberish!
I might have to smack you!
JoJo.
What are you doing?
G-Granny Erina!
What are you doing to that man?
Well, uh, you see...
Taxi!
I was just grabbing a taxi.
Oh, JoJo, you're so thoughtful.
Climb in, Smokey.
The Joestar family, just a grandmother and grandson.
Over time, I heard bits of their past.
Granny, Speedwagon called us all the way to New York, right?
And now he's off on a trip? He's unbelievable.
I'm sure his oil business has him tied up.
Hey, Granny...
Was Speedwagon really Grandpa's best friend?
That's all? Really?
What are you implying?
Well, he's single, right?
And you're a widow.
I just wondered if that was the extent of your relationship.
You scoundrel!
Sorry! Ow!
I was wrong! Forgive me!
I know Speedwagon is just loyal!
The Joestars were short-lived.
Erina lost her husband in an accident at sea.
The son she was pregnant with and
They became JoJo's parents, but were claimed by war and disease.
Maybe it was because she was lonely.
JoJo was the same.
Their kindness got him into trouble.
It was for my sake.
Hey, waiter! Waiter!
Yes?
You let that stinking animal in here?
His odor is ruining my appetite! You shouldn't let that kind in!
What? You mean you'll let beasts like that eat beasts in here?
I'll just be on my way.
JoJo!
Granny, you aren't going to stop me, are you?
No. People can have their own opinions...
...but he insulted a friend in public.
Take him down, but mind the other customers!
I was hoping you'd say that.
Looking for a scrap, boy?
If you're looking for your brass knuckles...
...they're not in your coat pocket!
Check your back pocket!
No way!
Now you'll say, "How did you know that, bastard?!"
How did you know that, bastard?!
Plus, the blood on your shirt isn't yours.
You just came from a fight.
Now you'll say, "So what, you little punk?!"
So what, you little punk?!
Gotcha!
You like that?! Don't get uppity with me!
I'm afraid you missed.
What are you punching?
It wasn't me you were pummeling so happily.
I can predict anything your simple brain can come up with.
Don't you get that, moron?
Please forgive my underling, madam.
You're Erina Joestar, aren't you?
I do a lot of business with Mr. Speedwagon.
He told me all about you in London a while back.
I heard something through the grapevine
Mr. Speedwagon was killed.
Are you serious?
Rumor has it his killer was a Tibetan monk.
A monk?
Straizo?
The bodies of Speedwagon and his team
No one knows why they were killed or where the monk went.
I think I might know.
It has to do with something Speedwagon said long ago.
It must involve the stone mask and Dio.
JoJo, that guy's a mafioso!
Don't trust him! It must be a scheme!
Believe what you want.
Try your breast pocket if you want your lighter.
Smokey, I appreciate the warning, but I believe what he says.
These guys are only after money.
Information like that is valuable to the Mob, so I believe it.
But!
Even if it's true, you can't just say
Do you see how you've upset her?!
You're thoughtless!
Events from 50 years ago are coming back to haunt us.
Don't be scared, Granny.
I'm here for you.
No, Joseph. I'm scared for you!
I don't want you to get wrapped up in this.
I'll be fine.
If it's my fate, I accept it.
I don't understand what is going on, but...
...these two must have an unimaginable history.
Hey, Smokey.
Chilly today, isn't it?
Take a look at this magazine.
What is it?
Do you think it can really make them bigger?
What's this? "Go from an AA cup to a C cup."
It's a bunch of snake oil. Don't buy into it.
What's that?
I think $1.25 a pair is too...
Let's see...
I say.
You look kind of familiar, yet different.
Tell me, have we met before?
Why isn't your breath steaming when it's so cold out?
And I think I caught a glimpse of fangs in your mouth just now.
Was I just seeing things?
Don't try to fool me.
Even out here in the streets, JoJo, I'm taking your life!
Before your abilities grow!
You think so?
I knew he was crazy, but not this crazy!
He's right in public!
Where did he even get that Tommy gun he's blasting away with?!
I was waiting for you, Straizo!
I don't think you'll go down so easily.
This is war!
Next episode
So this is a vampire!
I'll demolish you, Straizo!
German medicine is the world's greatest!
You don't understand a thing!
Apologize in hell!
Chapter 11: Master of the Game
The old woman in Egypt, Enyaba, told me
to shoot the arrow at those it desires.
They will become allies.
Those shot with the arrow
will be able to bring out just one special power hidden in their hearts.
I believe she called them Stands.
Jotaro Kujo and the others...
then I need to make more Stand users, more allies.
Now, arrow! Who do you want?
Choose! Choose them!
Pull
A telephone pole?
How is the telephone pole relev—
Could it be... you want that child?
Are you saying that child will be my ally?
V-Very well.
I just have to shoot that child, right?
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
Janken Boy Is Coming!
Well, if it isn't the manga artist, Rohan Kishibe.
Good morning, Mr. Joestar.
What are you shooting here?
I was sneaking some photos of businessmen heading to work.
he should be going to work every day, just like that person did.
Going to work...
Knowing he's a man between the ages of 25 and 35
who's around 175 centimeters tall and an office worker
I see...
But you can't be sure that he uses the station.
He might drive to work in a car.
That is possible.
But he only changed his face.
I'm pretty sure that the family of one of these men is already
Hey!
Mister, would you play janken with me?
Janken...
Hey, come on. It wouldn't hurt to play, would it?
What's with this kid?
Janken...
There's always at least one weirdo at any station.
Anyway, if you find any clues, please let me know, Mr. Joestar.
And you make sure you don't meddle in anything dangerous alone.
Hey, Mister. You're the manga artist guy, right?
Didn't your series take a break not long ago?
I read weekly.
So come on. It wouldn't hurt to play janken with me.
What's with you? Beat it!
I wanna play janken. Come on, please?
What's with this kid? He has a hole in his cheek!
I-It's deep.
Hey, come on! Hey, hey!
No hard feelings if you lose.
If we tie, we play again. If you shoot too late, you lose.
Got it? Ready, and...
Janken...
This brat is being oddly persistent.
Is he a Stand user?
Ready, and... Janken...
Heaven's Door!
Hmph.
Let's see...
His name is Ken Oyanagi, and he's eleven.
There's nothing about a Stand written here...
And it says the hole in his cheek was from falling off a telephone pole.
Loves "janken." Really wants to play "janken." Plays "scissors" first.
It looks like this kid really wants to play janken.
It's stupid, but...
Hey, guys. Are you getting in or not?
Would you mind waiting about 30 seconds?
Here we go.
Yeah, all right. You just want me to play, right?
Janken... hoi!
Well, see ya.
I... I lost...
I guess that's enough work for today.
Yo, Rohan-sensei.
Are you done with work already?
It's the shitbag Josuke, the idiot Okuyasu...
All people with whom I have nothing to talk about.
Sorry, but I'm still working. Some other time.
I see...
Hey, what are you doing? That's my seat.
You haven't sat down yet, have you?
This seat was empty, so I sat down.
Whoops.
What's with you? Why do you keep bugging me?
Let's use janken to decide who gets the seat. Okay?
Again?!
No! I sat here first!
This seat belongs to me!
Sir...
Hang on...
Rohan-sensei, just let him have it.
Don't make him cry. That's pretty immature of you.
Why don't you sit next to him?
Shut up! All of you, shut you mouths!
Fine! I'll play janken!
Janken's what you want, right?
That's the spirit! H-Here we go!
Janken... hoi!
Oh? Y-Yes, I won!
Take that!
So immature...
No, winning against a brat is the best feeling there is.
D-Damn it!
I can use this as reference material.
7,500 yen, huh...
Do I have that much on me?
Excuse me, can I get this book?
Why, you little...
Wanna decide with janken?
Fine!
Here we go! Janken...
Rock!
Stop messing around!
I won. See?
I finally won!
One win, two losses!
What the hell is this?!
Wh—
What?!
I-Impossible! Th-The hole...
Could he be a Stand user?!
What?!
S-So cool!
I didn't know something so cool would come out!
Beautiful and magnificent energy is flowing into me!
I'm feeling better!
H-Heaven's Door!
Make this kid into a book!
Open
Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.
This kid...
seemed to be bringing out his own Stand for the first time.
Could he be on his way to becoming a Stand user?
Hmph. "I want to beat the crap out of Rohan with janken," huh?
"Janken is not about probability.
It's all mental, dependent on how much you want to win.
Beating Rohan at janken means you've beaten him mentally.
Rohan Kishibe is only 20 years old, and he's already facing the world alone.
Not to mention, he's awed many people with his works.
If I beat the crap out of someone so widely admired, it means I'd surpass them.
I want to grow up to be someone people admire, just like Rohan."
So this kid really is on his way to becoming a Stand user!
He must have only just been hit by the arrow.
"Ability... When I beat my opponent in janken, their energy becomes mine.
However, we have to play five times.
If I don't win three times, I can't take all of it."
Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.
attack Rohan Kishibe.
attack Rohan Kishibe.
Can attack Rohan Kishibe.
Wh-What?
That's so cool. So this ability is called a "Stand"?
but I've already absorbed one third of your Stand.
I-Its right arm is missing!
I can move one third of Heaven's Door!
I won't let you read my mind anymore.
You brat...
If I win two more times, all of your ability will be mine!
You brat! Who do you think you are?!
You had some nerve to hit me with your fist earlier.
That's payback, you moron!
Very well.
Good!

Do you understand the situation you're in?
You can't lose again.
Do you understand that you're cornered?
Now that I know you're a Stand user, I won't hold back anymore!
I'm going to knock you out.
Are you trying to pressure me?
All right, let's do this.
No, we're not doing that yet.
but I think that might be childish.
so I was thinking about turning that around and going with paper.
All right, I've got it.
Here we go!
Janken... hoi!
What?!
I did it! I forced my hand against Rohan mentally, and won with paper!
Rohan
Ken
5 Matches
Now I've got two wins and two losses.
Now, then...
I took your lower half.
If you're tired, should we head over to the bench?
No, there's no need.
When you win, it's best to be
looking down on your opponent just like this.
But you know, I really don't feel like I'm going to lose now.
After I lost twice at first, I won twice in a row.
You're the opposite, Rohan-sensei. You've lost twice in a row.
You're currently on the downhill slope in this match!
This is amazing!
No wonder the arrow picked this kid!
If this kid is able to obtain Rohan Kishibe's ability
It'll help out my Yoshikage.
You brat...
It's the truth that you've lost twice in a row.
The truth, huh... Indeed.
In that case, let me give you a dose of truth, as well.
In our next match, you will definitely not use paper.
I'm not so sure about that.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold it.
I used rock twice in a row and lost.
Which means that rock is the unluckiest choice for me.
It's only natural that I wouldn't be able to use the unlucky rock a third time.
If you use paper, it's like admitting that I am actually not going downhill.
I'll force my hand and beat you!
Let's go, Rohan Kishibe!
It's on!
Jan...
...ken...
...hoi!
After all that pressure, he still used paper.
There's no way I'll lose!
I'll use paper four times in a row! I'm gonna force my hand!
All right! Rock! I'll get the unlucky rock on my side!
One more...
Th-The strength in my knees...
What? He's using a different form than before!
The only one Rohan hasn't used yet is scissors...
Crap... Going with paper again is dangerous!
Crap!
I guess rock wasn't unlucky after all!
Damn that Rohan!
Th-That's...
Hey, Mister!
Hey, Rohan-sensei. Those two are probably Stand users, too, right?
They are, right? I can feel it.
Let's test my luck.
If I'm protected by strong luck, they definitely won't come over here.
Hey, that's Rohan.
Hey! Hey!
I really hate that guy.
Hmm... Well, hmm...
Menacing
That child...
Menacing
I do believe he's...
a fan of his.
See you later.
See ya.
It looks like strong luck is on my side, Rohan-sensei.
because I'm protected by strong luck!
Right now, I feel like I could survive Russian roulette
Crash
It's a shower of glass!
Now, let's have our final match to see who'll win, Rohan-sensei!
What are you doing?
You're the one who needs to hurry up and get started.
I'm going to go with this.
Stop messing around.
No, I'm dead serious.
It's not very hard to make others lose.
The most difficult thing is... Listen carefully, now...
The most difficult thing is
to surpass yourself!
I'm now going to surpass my own luck!
Let's go, Rohan!
It's on!
Janken hoi!
Yes! How's that, Rohan Kishibe?!
Wh-What?
What?!
Huh?
Wh-What the?
Why is my hand shaped as rock?!
Now I have three wins and two losses.
You have the unlucky rock.
Strong luck came to me a moment ago, along with Joseph Joestar.
The Invisible Baby.
Huh?!
Will save Rohan when he's in danger. Will become invisible and make the kid's hand into "rock."
You only relied on your strong luck, and I changed my luck.
That's what it means to surpass yourself.
Boom
Now, then. I'm going to knock you out now, as I promised.
"You'll never be able to win at janken again.
Sh-Shut up!
Stay away from me, Rohan!
O-Otherwise, this baby's gonna...
Do you understand what you're doing?
Hmph! Right now, our match is a verbal argument!
You haven't really won against me!
You won because you cheated, you coward!
Let the baby go.
Fight me one more time!
And I'm telling you to let the baby go.
I'll fight you.
I'll make you lose! Janken, hoi! Hoi! Hoi!
I-I-I can't win!
D-Damn it! I made you into a Stand user and you still lost!
See ya!
You won't die.
If...
If I have to obey what you write...
If I'm going to be mentally controlled by you...
I'd rather die like this!
Take that, Rohan Kishibe!
Pfft
Nice. I like you, kid.
I feel moved when I see people who are...
Dash
dramatic like you!
Wha?!
Y-You'll be run over, too!
You think so?
What the? Th-The wind!
Whoa, what the hell is this picture?!
I-I can't see in front of me!
I-It avoided us and drove by?
Y-You could have died, too, but you did that for me...
Was it strong luck?
You've become quite impressive in such a short time.
I won't knock you out.
However, don't use that Stand for evil anymore.
I carelessly bumped into it, damn it!
I lost. I've completely lost.
Hey, Rohan!
D-Did you see the baby?
She's missing, Sensei!
N-No, it might be that we just can't see her.
C-Crap...
Hey, where are you?
I'll just pretend I don't know and look with them...
Wh-Where did you go? Where are you?
Janken Kid. Real name: Ken Oyanagi.
Hey!
Stand name: Boys Man Man.
Unable to fight.
For some reason, the hole in his cheek is still there.

The arrow chose him, but it was deflected.

Where are you?
Summer...
There are many more tourists around town now.
Yeah...
I doubt that he'll be able to stay put.
I'm sure he won't be able to resist making a move.
The summer season is finally upon us.
On July 1st, the beach and rivers in Morioh were opened to the public.
Relaxing at a summer villa, camping, fishing, yachting...
There are many fun activities to find here this time of year!
How are you all going to enjoy your summer?
Yes, many fun things...
I'm sure he has
many fun things to do, too.
People live while hiding what's deep in their hearts from others.
But...
Is there anyone who has
Damn it!
I want her to hear how I feel deep down inside...
That I want to take your slender neck into these hands

O-Of course. It should be obvious.
You were reading a book.
Um, I poured some tea for you.
b-but if you'd like some...
If you don't want it, that's fine, too...
Oh, look at the time.
I think I'll go to bed...
Open up your heart to that woman.
Yoshikage Kira.
D-Darling?
Crap. Opening up is a bad idea.
I'm sorry I startled you.
H-He was trying to undo the buttons in the back?
"I'm sorry I startled you"?
Not at all! All of your actions lately
have been exciting me to no end!
And they make me feel thrilled! I...
I've fallen
in love with you.
J-Josuke, l-look over there.
What the heck is—
Is this... Could this be...
T-Terri Funk—
It's a crop circle!
Yeah! A crop circle!
Th-That's amazing!
Something's not right, Okuyasu.
Take a closer look at the middle of that thing.
Something's really wrong here!
You're gonna go in?
We don't have a choice!
Be careful.
Yeah.
I-Is he alive?
Hey, wake up. Are you all right? Hey!
I've never seen him at our school.
Oh, looks like he's awake.
Where...
Where am I?
Where?
You're right in the middle of a field in Budogaoka, Morioh.
Is this Earth?
Last night, I suddenly felt ill.
I then lost consciousness, it would seem.
It's past eight, so I was unconscious for thirteen Earth hours.
He totally tried to pull one over us!
Damn! I can't believe you tried to pull such an elaborate prank!
Man, you sure got me!
You're a really funny guy!
So you made a crop circle and waited
Amazing! That's amazing!
I can't breathe! My stomach hurts!
That's so stupid!
What school do you go to?
School?
We love guys like you!
My planet is in the Magellanic Clouds, but it has been destroyed.
I came to Earth to find out
if it's a suitable place to live, and if the people are nice.
you're going to ruin your own brilliant idea.
Here, have a tissue.
Thank you. That was quite delicious.
W-We should really get to school.
Y-Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.
That guy ate the tissue.
He's a guy who takes jokes too far.
The ice cream shop's closed!
And it's our only comfort on Monday mornings...
It can't be helped.
Let's give up for today.
Would you like some ice cream?
Well? Do you want some?
Yeah, but the shop's closed, so there's nothing we can do.
There's no reason for you to give up.
I just happen to have two.
We can call it a trade for the tissue earlier.
Earth seems like a very nice place to live.
It's cold...
Wh-Why did you have ice cream cones in your bag?
Are those ice cream cones not good enough?
That's not what I'm asking! Who the hell are you?
I believe I told you that moments ago...
Ah! You want to hear me introduce myself?
My name is Nu Mikitakazo Nshi.
I am 216 years old.
My hobby is having pets.
I'm even currently carrying a house mouse in my bag.
It is very happy when I pet its back.
This guy's a Stand user. There's no doubt about it.
Let's kick his ass, Josuke!
Calm down, Okuyasu.
Do you really think a Stand user
Th-Then what the hell is with him?
There, there, there.
I have no idea.
Huh?!
So you're 216, you say?
Yes.
Hmm...
Hmm...
And your occupation is a spaceship pilot?
Why do you keep copying me?
So, what?
Are you trying to say that you're an alien?
An alien!
An alien! Yes!
I'm an alien.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Then, like, your... flying saucer?
Could you call over your spaceship?
Of course.
it would take about three days.
I can't bring it immediately.
Are you going to call it with that watch of yours?
Oh, how did you know?
But this is a secret between us.
This guy is totally messed up in the head.
He wasn't joking earlier at all.
He's a delusional, crazy bastard.
Should I punch him?
You always want to throw punches first.
Let's take it a bit further, just to be sure.
Of course I do.
But I didn't come to Earth to fight, so I left them in my spaceship.
Aw, come on. If you're an alien, show us something.
And your blood wasn't even green.
Yeah. Alien blood is always green.
Do you two doubt me?
Hey, calm down.
You finally got it? You moron!
but I don't have time to deal with delusional freaks like you.
You didn't have to just come out and say that!
Shut up! It's better to be up-front!
What? Is there a fire somewhere?
Wh-What the hell?
This sound... I don't like this sound.
This sound...
Stop this sound!
I don't like this sound!
I'm allergic to it!
Make it stop!
Josuke, this guy's dangerous!
But don't you think
leaving him like that is a bit cruel?
He said he's allergic to that sound, right? Just leave him be.
I'm leaving, Josuke.
H-Hey!
Damn it, Okuyasu.
H-Hey, you okay?
take me somewhere I can't hear this sound...
Wh-What?!
Please take me away!
A-Are you actually...
I have a power that allows me to turn into anything.
H-Hurry... I feel like my head will split open amidst this sound...
Please...
I'll turn into sneakers, so please, wear them and take me with you!
In return, I'll do anything for you!
Are you a Stand user?!
Whoa! Y-You're super fast!
Are you seriously an alien?!

He can't see it!
He's not a Stand user.
Who the hell are you?!
You're rather persistent, aren't you?
Hang on a sec.
L-Let me sort this out in my head.
Anyway, you saved me by taking me away from that.
The people on my planet can't stand the sound of sirens.
It's a wavelength that aggravates our nerves.
I'd like to do something for you to thank you for saving me.
Shall I turn into a fan and fan you?
Or maybe a back scratcher so I can scratch your back?
Whoa, it's not like I saved you because I wanted something in return...
You'll really do anything? Please! Do it! Thank you!
Shopping Catalog
What would you like me to do?
C-Can you turn into anything?
Like something light, or multiple numbers of something?
Yes. I can turn into almost anything.
However, I cannot turn into complicated machinery
I see, I see. Got it. I like you!
So you're going to thank me, right?
Yes.
I-I...
just had a brilliant idea.
It's an idea that'll make everyone happy.
Happy?
Yeah!
but my mom found out and froze the account I put it in.
Once she finds something like that, there's no convincing her.
It sucks not having any money for the summer season.
Shopping Catalog
And so...
Can you turn into this? This thing.
What is that?
They're dice!
What do you do with those?
Huh? You don't know what dice are?
I-I'm sorry...
You don't have to apologize.
It's really easy. I'll show you.
These are tools that people who like games really love.
They're hard, and they have six sides.
This divot represents the number one, and it has them from one through six.
Ah, yes. I think I'm starting to understand.
So when there are five divots, it's the number five, right?
Well done, alien!
And three divots represent a three.
Yes! Try turning into one.
Understood.
That was simple.
What are you talking about? You're way too big.
You're only supposed to be about this big.
The numbers on a die are from one through six.
The numbers on one side and its opposite side should equal seven.
Oh, pardon me.
How about this?
Th-That tickles!
Hey, don't laugh. Dice don't talk.
Huh?
Come on.
I-I'll do my best.
I'm a bit nervous about this, but...
Yes, you're good! Very good! This is perfect!
I'm getting excited!
Rohan Kishibe, I hope you have some money waiting for me!
I-I can't breathe...
Oh, look who it is.
What does Josuke Higashikata want with me?
This is a rare occurrence.
Did you get more information concerning Kira?
No, not exactly...
Um, well...
Are you done with work today?
I was wondering if I could have a peek at your next chapter...
What are you plotting?
D-Damn...
I can't hide anything from you, Rohan-sensei.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
Please! Play Cee-lo with me!
Cee-lo?
I have no spending money for the summer.
Well, I have 30,000 yen. It's my life savings.
But...
Nowadays, 30,000 yen is gone after you make one or two trips
So all that's left is to make more money, or go flat broke.
Wagering on the thrill!
That's what I think! Don't you agree?!
Look, I'll be straight with you. I've always disliked you.
So why should I have to play Cee-lo with you?
Yeah, you're right.
so you have no reason to play.
But... All right.
Huh?! You'll do it?
I don't dislike games, and this seems fun.
Come around to the back.
Thank you, Rohan-sensei.
The shooter rolls 3 dice into the bowl
This will result in paying double
This will result in winning double
The larger number wins (here, the 6)
Do these rules work for you?
No arguments here.
Chips cost 1,000 yen each.
Got it.
All right. Let's tape the rules up here.
Okay, let's do this!
Wait.
We won't be using your dice.
Huh?!
We'll be playing with these dice I had in the house.
U-Um, is there something wrong with my dice?
No idea. There's just something that I don't like about them.
And...
I did say this seemed fun, but I wasn't talking about Cee-lo.
I meant that it'd be fun taking your 30,000 yen from you.
When you lose, you'd better pay up for real.
It doesn't matter how well acquainted we are, Josuke-kun.
Yes! Those dice are the ones that the alien turned into!
I snuck them into your house ahead of time!
I'm such a villain.
It won't be much, but I'll be making some money off of you, Rohan-sensei.
Now, let's roll to see who goes first.
I rolled a four.
Yes!
All right, you go first. Go ahead and roll.
Ow!
O...
O-Ow! I accidentally hit the table.
Hurry up and bet and roll your dice.
R-Right...
I-I'll start off with two, I think, so that'll be 2,000 yen.
Okay, here's two.
so I really need to make sure I don't get one, two, and three.
Better not get a one, two, and three! Not a one, two, and three!
I-I'll go really lightly on the first roll.
Here we go... Lightly.
How's that?!
Huh?!
What?
A-An omen...
What?
Triple sixes, AKA "omen."
S-Stupid! You're not supposed to start off with that!
E-Er, I mean...
I meant that was some stupid luck!
A triple six, meaning you have to pay five times my bet...
Hmph. It seems you've already earned 10,000 yen in spending money.
Let's continue the game.
I can't believe my luck myself...
I want to get back what I just lost, so I'm...
going with ten.
Ten?
All right! Go!
One, two, and three. The wager is doubled!
The shooter rolls 3 dice into the bowl
This will result in paying double
Rohan has to pay Josuke double what he wagered.
This is too much! This is way too much!
Does that alien not know what "holding back" means?
Crap... He's totally suspicious of me!
Episode 28 Highway Go Go, Part 1
Episode 28 Higho Go Part 1
Don't touch those dice, Josuke Higashikata!
Don't move an inch.
What's he going to do?
If Rohan finds out that I've been using that alien to cheat...
just apologizing is definitely not going to cut it.
What are you checking?
I could be imagining it, but I feel like the dice are staring at me.
Gulp.
Ba-dum, ba-dum...
Hmph. Well, whatever. Let's continue the game.
Rohan... Adds 30 New Chips
W-Well, then... I'll go easy and just bet two.
You get it now, right, Alien?
I need to just manage to win.
I just need to be a tiny bit ahead in the end.
All right, go!
H-He doesn't get it!
I guess what happens twice is bound to happen a third time.
I suppose it's possible to roll this more than once.
An omen is worth five times the bet, yes?
I'll pay up.
Right... I guess things that happen twice can happen a third time.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Highway Go Go, Part 1
Wh-Wh-Wha...
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm not sure how, but I know that you're cheating.
That's unforgivable...
Dude, you're messed up in the head!
You're infuriating.
but you are currently trying to make a fool of me.
Just thinking about you laughing deep down inside is unbearable.
Let me see your hand. I'll have Shining Diamond fix it.
Shut up!
Do you know why I did that to my pinky?
So that you won't be able to forfeit the game, Josuke Higashikata!
I won't let a doofus like you underestimate the great Rohan!
We'll both just play one more time.
In that time, I swear I will figure out how you're cheating.
If I am unable to determine how you're cheating...
There's two million yen there.
I'll use that to ask you to fix my pinky with Shining Diamond.
I'm going to take your pinky, Josuke Higashikata.
Hey, you two look like you're having fun.
Hey, it's me. Been a while, Josuke!
I was stuck in the hospital for a month.
Tamami?
I called him earlier and asked him to act as an official.
An official?
I'm Tamami Kobayashi.
using this lock that attaches to your heart.
I will work fairly, no matter who wins or who is involved.
I charge 20%, or 400,000 yen, whichever sum is larger.
You will both play one more time
and see if you can figure out the cheat or not, correct?
Yeah.
What?!
so I will ensure that doesn't happen.
I will create a rule where Tamami's lock will automatically attack you.
This really isn't good... But I have to do this!
I have to keep the cheat going to the end and break through this!
Well, then... I'll go first.
How's that?!
A four!
A pair of three's and a four!
Yes! That throw ended up being normal "naturally."
I-It's my turn next, right?
Hmph. You look rather relieved.
It's as though something you asked someone to do went well.
Don't get rattled. Rohan hasn't figured it out.
I'm just going to keep playing!
H-He threw up?!
C-Crap! He's getting dizzy!
It's because Rohan shook him around so much.
Josuke! Don't you dare hide the dice with your hand.
Huh?
I can't see them.
Huh? I wonder if there's a fire somewhere.
Wh-What? Sirens?!
Th-This guy's allergic to sirens.
Crap! He's going to turn back!
What are you doing? You're being suspicious!
Sorry so sudden, but that was a yell to get me hyped up!
I'll throw now!
Go! Do it!
It's a 666 omen!
The lock didn't move. Josuke is cheating!
Well? Did you figure it out, Rohan-sensei?
Or are you admitting defeat, Rohan-sensei?
Looks like the rash isn't showing up on Rohan's side.
Please hang in there!
Did you figure it out or not?
I'm done for...
That's... I've got it!
He knows!
I've got it! The fire's here!
Huh?!
Rohan-sensei, your house is on fire!
It's the magnifying glass!
We were too busy with the game to even notice!
Shut up! I don't care if my house is burning!
It's more important that I figure out how Josuke is cheating!
What are you talking about?!
W-Well, I'll be going now...
Wait, Josuke!
But first, I'm going to fix your pinky.
No one asked you to do that!
Josuke, wait! You bastard!
That was close... But I guess I have a way of making people resent me, huh?
I had no idea.
You seem down.
Was I able to be of use to you?
Sh-Shut up, jeez!

Now, all you drivers out there, please be careful when driving.
and the young rider was badly injured.
Police later found out...
Lately, Mom's been acting strange.
and she's in a good mood...
Did something happen?
It's been a while since Mom got naked in front of Dad.
Am I a child that was born to parents who loved each other?
What's he doing?
Josuke Higashikata... Jotaro Kujo...
It's their fault I'm in this mess.
Oh, Josuke-san. Thank you for yesterday.
Where did you sleep and eat after what happened yesterday?
Mikitaka! Mikitaka!
You need to stay right behind me!
We just moved here, so there's a lot we must do.
All right, Mother. I'll be right there.
H-Huh?
Don't tell me you're pulling jokes on people again
If he said that to you, please don't think anything of it.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
Huh? What?!
I brainwashed her into thinking that I'm her son.
The name "Mikitaka Hazekura" is the name I'm using on Earth.
Mikitaka! Come here this instant!
Mikitaka Hazekura...Alien or Stand User?!
What was that?
What was with that brat?
Was he actually an alien?
The way he pulled Josuke and Rohan Kishibe apart was very effective...
But!
Why are you avoiding eye contact with me?
You should at least greet me.
After all, I am older than you, Josuke Higashikata.
Sorry about yesterday.
Yes. About 2,500,000 yen worth of furniture identical to
Not that I care in the least.
What's wrong? Sit down.
Someday, I will pay you back for yesterday's dice game.
What?
That was...
Josuke, did you see that?
There was a door to a house in the tunnel wall.
There's someone inside!
There's a window, too!
There's a room in the tunnel wall.
A room that someone lives in!
There's a man, too!
What is he doing?!
Josuke, did you see that?!
Shut the hell up, Rohan Kishibe!
How long are you going to try to mess with me?!
Can no one else see it?
Is that house... a new Stand user?
The man who cut off that woman's hand...
Yoshikage Kira?!
Morioh Landmark 8 "Futatsumori Tunnel"
Completed in year 5 of the Kaei Period (1852). Fixed in year 28 of the Showa Period. 450 meters in length. Is on the road connecting S City and Morioh. Because it is curved inside, the exit is not visible from the entrance. As there is very little light, there are many accidents, and since is it rather creepy, it's considered haunted by young people.
Futatsumori Tunnel
There was a room inside the tunnel?!
You're not fooling me!
You want to get back at me by telling me a stupid lie like that?
You don't believe me, Josuke Higashikata?
A liar like you who cheats with dice...
has the nerve to call me a liar?
It appears we truly do not get along.
I guess you wouldn't understand, even if you went back there with me.
All right, let's go.
That's the exit.
There was nothing there.
There was nothing here but a wall.
Maybe it really was an illusion.
What?!
Ch
Th-This is...
Th-The room I saw from the bus.
It appeared out of nowhere!
Though the man and woman I saw earlier aren't here.
Crap! Something's there!
So this room was a trap after all!
It's coming... Something's there!
I can't see it, but something's coming at me!
Something came toward me.
I couldn't see it, but it came right toward me.
It was something not human.
That room was a trap.
The man that resembled Kira was also an illusion.
Now I know that room is a Stand.
I can't handle it alone. Should I tell Mr. Joestar about it?
What? It's chasing after me!
What is that?!
These... These things that look like footprints...
Are they the Stand?
60km/h!
I managed to get away.
Apparently if I go faster than 60km/h, it can't keep up.
Is it being remotely controlled?
What?!
Crap! It caught up to me!
I only slowed down a little bit!
Th-This thing...
I'll turn it into a book and control it!
Heaven's Door!
Crap... It's sucking out my power...
but here I am.
I'm a liar who always does something different from what he says.
What?!
W-Wait... C-Could this be...
Rohan's motorcycle? the motorcycle?!
Smash
Th-That thing...
Give me nutrients... Give me your nutrients!
Heaven's Door!
The Stand's name is Highway Go Go.
That room was a trap.
Once one is touched by Highway Go Go, its weak spot...
Its weak spot...
d-doesn't exist?!
I-It's no use... I don't have any strength.
I can't read any more.
I can't even write an order on him...
I can't...
Rohan!
Hey, are you here, Rohan?!
Josuke... I can't believe you came back...
A comrade...
Your name is Rohan?
Hey, Rohan! Answer me! Where are you?
Rohan!
Th-That's...
R-Rohan?!
Go on, Rohan... Ask him to save you.
What the hell is that room?
Call out for help.
Are you all right?!
I've left just a bit of your nutrients in you.
If you ask him for help, I'll spare your life.
Because I'll take his nutrients instead.
Now... Help me lure him into this room.
I'll spare your life. Hurry up and call him.
What the hell is this room?
Hurry up and say it.
It's not like you two love each other, is it?
I told you to ask him for help.
Do you want to die?
I-If I lure him in here...
w-will you really...
spare my life?
Yeah, I promise.
Call him. Hurry up and call him!
I refuse.
What?!
One of my absolute favorite things to do
is to tell someone who thinks they're tough, "no."
Run, Josuke!
If you come into this room, you have no chance!
You bastard!
Do you really think I'd run away
I'll kick his ass.
Where is he?
H—
I even told you of the danger...
You always do the opposite of what I think you'll do.
And that's why I hate you.
That's why you piss me off! You're going to be attacked!
Now he's got your scent!
Smash
Yes! I got him!
Heaven's Door!
Your body will fly backwards at 70km/h!
Josuke, Highway Go Go will follow you anywhere at 60km/h!
Look for the user!
Shut up already, you idiot!
Rohan!
Rohan Kishibe...
To think that you'd actually save me...
It's... It's unbelievable, but I'm moved!
All right, Rohan.
I just have to find that thing's user, right?
I just need to find the user and kick his ass!
Wait for me, Rohan!
Episode 29 Highway Go Go, Part 2
o Go, Part 2
I swear I'll save you, so wait for me, Rohan!
So it learned my scent?
Yes!
That thing can't go faster than 60km/h!
This bike'll have no problem beating that.
But how the hell am I supposed to find the user?
I guess I'll sort out everything I know about him first.
First, why did he set up a trap inside the tunnel?
It would have been easier to ambush us from the roadside.
Second, I think there's more to his sucking out nutrients.
There's got to be a reason for that tunnel.
I've got to check out that tunnel!
Koichi!
I need to call Koichi and have him use Reverb to find the user!
Now, now. What's the matter? There, there...
All right. There should be plenty of distance between us now.
Where's my card?
Y-You can't be serious!
Why'd it suddenly appear?
I ran away at 80km/h, and it was going 60km/h.
That thing is a Stand.
It can appear and disappear freely...
and now it's going to accurately
attack me by following my scent!
S-Sixty kilometers...
Wh-What?!
Shit! A baby carriage!
What's the matter with you? You're so fussy...
If I slow down, I'm gonna die.
Rohan will die, as well.
I have to just bust through!
But, Shining Diamond!
Fix.
Good!
I'll never be able to make a phone call like this!

Listen up, Yoshioka.
This is a deal worth one billion!
You'd better not mess this up!
I'm counting on you, Yoshioka!
Y-Yes, sir! Please leave it to me.
This is it! This cell phone!
It just happened to show up at the perfect time. Lucky me!
I will do my absolute best!
Talk about a silver lining!
Hello?
Huh?
Gah! One billion yen!
Did that happen when I grabbed it?
My silver lining just broke!
If you hate me, just hang up on me!
H-How can you say that, Minayo?
Say it! Ask her to marry you!
Minayo, will you m-marry—
Man, I think I might be lucky today.
Huh? What? What is it, Akira?
Talk about good timing!
Hello, Hirose residence.
Koichi!
So that's what's happening.
If I don't find the user, I'm gonna get killed.
I think it's a guy who has some kind of
Are there any incidents involving that tunnel?
Th-There is. It's in the paper from two days ago.
I saw the news on TV, too.
Some thug on a motorcycle was driving drunk
John Doe is unconscious and in critical condition with injuries all over his body.
Sounds like he's a victim of the Stand, too.
W-Wait a sec.
Th-That Stand is one that sucks up nutrients, right?
This sounds like a different injury.
Isn't it possible that the John Doe
He needs nutrients from other people to heal himself...
What? I-It's the ocean!
If I keep going straight, I'll be in trouble!
I need to turn somewhere, or I'm gonna plunge into the ocean!
That corner!
Hello? Josuke? What's wrong?
Koichi! Keep me on the line. Don't hang up!
Here I go, damn it!
Crap! I might crash!
No.
I can do this right now.
I can make this turn. I will make this turn, damn it!
Yes! I made the turn!
Did you see how I hung in there?! Take that!
Wh-What?!
The ocean's on this side, too!
No Entry
Shining Diamond!
Now for the crumbled wall...
Fix it!
Th-That was close...
Like a mosquito that can't see a screen, it's following me by scent alone.
It doesn't have the ability to think or plan its attacks.
Its only goal is to take nutrients from me.
The theory that this guy's the critically injured patient makes sense.
Everything fits together.
Josuke!
Koichi, the hospital!
Find out his name for me.
Got it.
But, man, this situation is heavy...
H-How am I supposed to get out of this?
How far did he go? That little shit Josuke...
When this arrow wanted to pierce a motorcycle thug
I was wondering what the hell it was thinking, but...
Who would have thought he would create this amazing Highway Go Go?
A Stand ability is all about the user's mental strength!
The hungrier someone is, the stronger they are!
No one can defeat the power of a man so hungry to heal his own injuries.
But I really would have loved to see Josuke die!
What should I do? What should I do?
A culvert!
but it just keeps getting closer and closer.
H-How am I going to get out of here?
Wh-Which way should I go?
The ocean is definitely bad news.
The left is the way I came from... I think.
Wh-Which way do I go now?
I think the left might be the ocean, but if I go to the right...
Th-There's the middle, too...
Wh-What's happening?
I'm pressing the gas, but the speed keeps dropping...
I-Is it breaking down?
Wh-What?! It's not broken?
Then why am I losing speed?
I-It's coming!
Could it be...
Am I out of gas?
Man, don't scare me like that.
Then there's no problem at all.
I thought it was some
This isn't a problem.
There'll be no problem escaping this.
Still no problem.
I can fix this with no problem.
but gasoline is not a problem.
But it seems
that I do have a problem after all...
I'm lost!
Wh-Which way is the hospital?

What's his room number?
Please tell me!
Now, listen...
Can you not see what's written there?
Huh?
Visiting hours are over for the day
Um, I'm not actually here to visit him.
But there's a reason I need to know his name!
Please, tell me!
Didn't you hear me tell you to go home?
Worthless brats like you are such a bother.
You seem pretty short for a motorcycle gang member.
Do your feet even reach the ground?
Jeez.

They're heavy?!
They're going to fall!
Hey, you! Help me! Hold me up!
Um, by "Hey, you!" did you mean me?
Yes! Who else is here?! This is really heavy!
Well, yeah, but still...
You did just tell me to go home.
Not to mention, I'm so short, I don't know if I can reach.
Are you going to get in trouble with your boss if those break?
Then you're going to be like, "Oh my gah!" Isn't it?
All right, fine! I'll tell you!
He's in room 525!
Take that elevator to the fifth floor!
Huh?
Josuke!
Koichi...
Did you find out where he is, Koichi?
Room 525! His name is Yuya Fungami!
Thanks, Koichi!
It's on the fifth floor! Hurry and get into the elevator!
Sh-Shit...
I-It just keeps coming in!
Koichi! Reverb Act 3!
You really are a guy I can count on. Thanks, Koichi!
But 3 Freeze can only attack one place at a time.
The rest of them are following Josuke!
There it is! Room 525!
I'm finally here!
The vent!
You bastard!
This distance is a pain!
Damn it!
and kick your ass...
Who the hell is that brat?
This is Yu's room!
Don't mistake it for your own, you dumbass!
Don't worry about him.
You okay?
I thought it had been a while
So you're the second one I've been chasing around, huh?
I'm surprised you really made it here.
Yu, you know this guy?
Huh?
Nah, I don't know him, and I don't give a shit.
Great job, Highway Go Go.
I've healed up quite a bit.
I'll be fully recovered.
Hey!
We told you not to lay your lazy ass down there!
And I just told you not to worry about him!
More importantly, come over here and give me some attention.
Little ol' me can't even move yet.
I really have to take a piss. My bladder's super full.
Ooh! That's my job!
We promised we'd all take turns doing that!
It's my turn this time!
What? No, it's me!
I don't care who it is.
Okay!
Then I'll...
Hey, Akemi.
That peach is rotten.
How can you tell it's rotten?
Why? Because it reeks.
It totally smells rotten.
From over there?
You've got a point.
Oh, you're right... It really is rotten.
One of you three is on your period, right?
Am I wrong? Someone's on her period, right?
Huh?
Ha, so it's you, Yoshie!
Looks like I was right.
and I can smell it.
What the hell are you mad about? Is it you, Reiko?
Huh? I'm not mad.
We're all really happy that you're feeling better, Yu.
Yeah, we're super happy!
There's no reason for any of us to be mad.
Hey, hey, something's not right.
It totally reeks of someone being pissed off.
Don't lie to me.
It's me!
I'm the one who reeks of all that adrenaline!
Impossible!
How the hell are you standing?
That's because...
You were drinking my IV fluid?
It wasn't much, but I replenished myself.
Release Rohan, the guy you're holding captive in the tunnel!
You fool!
Yu!
You three, don't move!
My name is Josuke Higashikata.
My Stand's name is Shining Diamond.
Hey, stop! Wait!
M-My spine is still broken.
I'm critically injured!
And you're saying that you're going to hurt pitiful ol' me?
All right, my bad. I'll free the guy in the tunnel.
I think he's still alive.
If you replenish his nutrients, I think he'll live...
S-So...
You wouldn't do something as cowardly as kicking
That's not something a man would do!
Yeah! That's cowardly!
Oh, I see.
It's definitely not manly, and it pains my heart.
Right? The guilt will stick with you forever if you kick my ass.
I thought about that, so I already fixed you.
Huh?!
Eh?
Can you move?
Th-They are...
Right.
it wouldn't be cowardly at all, would it?
Yuya Fungami continues his hospital stay.
Josuke threatens to kick his ass over and over.
I feel so refreshed.
I feel like it's New Year's morning
Yu!
However, it's rather enviable that he gets to be nursed
Meanwhile, Rohan...
Josuke Higashikata...
a lot's happened, but I, uh...
Why did you heal me?
Huh?
You meddlesome brat.
I would have rather die than be saved by you.
Not to mention, you stepped into the enemy's trap after I told you to run.
How stupid can you be?
Wha—
Just so you know, I don't consider this a favor I need to return.
...apparently still doesn't get along with Josuke.
Also...
After all this happened, Koichi Hirose took his dog for a walk.

Cats Love Yoshikage Kira
Episode 30 ve Yoshikage Kira
All of Kosaku Kawajiri's shoes are a bit big for my own feet.
I need to switch them with
Hayato.
Aren't you going to say goodbye?
Have a good day.
Darling!
Something terrifying happened in the basement!
It was so scary! I thought I was going to die!
Like that, and that, and that!
You see... There's a cat I've never seen before in the basement!
A cat?
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Cats Love Yoshikage Kira
So the reason it was really scary...
I went down to the basement
And you know how much I love cats, right?
So I was like, "Oh, it's a British Blue."
Where did you come in from?
Oh, dear. It's being defensive.
It must have come in from there.
But I can't let it stay down here forever.
It's okay to get closer if you don't make eye contact, right?
Oh, right. I just need to let it know that I'm not its enemy.
See? My belly's up, which means I'm being submissive.
Let's be friends.
Why am I trying to humor a cat?
If you don't get out of here, I'll hit you with this!
You hear? I'll throw it!
Darn it!
Why, you!
It was clinging to the ceiling like some kind of bug!
A-And what really creeped me out was
that the cat had a hole in its throat.
A hole about as big as a one-yen coin!
And then, from the hole, I heard...
Mreow
A hole?
Could it be a hole from the arrow?
I just frantically waved the broom around and ran.
Please, could you go check it out? It was really creepy.
It had a hole... right?
Hey... Is it gone? Did it run away?
No... It's dead.
Huh? What are you talking about?
W-Wait...
One of the shards went right into its throat.
Wait a minute! I was just—
It was an accident.
It's not your fault.
Apparently it had a hole in its throat, but...
Now there's no way to tell if it was a Stand user or not.
No, I'm sure it wasn't...
Good morning, Morioh.
Isn't it a refreshing morning, now that the rain's stopped?
I just saw a rainbow in the sky
"Where am I, mrowr?
What am I doing here? Meow, meow," he thought.
"M-My body's different from usual!
Where did he bury it?
I'm so sorry, kitty. Please rest in peace.
"Who's this human lady?
I get a bad feeling from her," he thought.
"The broom! That's it! Now I remember!
This woman...
The reason I'm like this now
He was perplexed.
"What? Something came out.
My toenail? Wh-Why?!
Is it a curse? C-Could it be that cat?!
That's... a Stand user!
Why is this thing growing from where I buried the cat yesterday?
Just what is this thing?
What did it do to that sparrow?
The most important thing is whether that thing is an enemy or not.
Is it an enemy who wishes to harm me, or is it...
I should probably kill it, just in case.
It fell asleep after eating.
The way it turned around because it thought it was being called
The fact that it can't resist trying to smell me is also like a cat.
It looks like it might be okay to pet it.
The way it's purring creepily
But I'm still not sure if it has any hostility toward me or not.
Let's find out.
This is definitely the cat that I buried here yesterday.
So it really did have a hole in its throat from the arrow!
D-Darling?
The woman!
That place scares me.
This cat attacked her because it had a grudge against her!
If she found out about this thing...
That rumor might eventually reach Jotaro Kujo and the others!
That would definitely be bad news!
That's where you buried the cat, right?
It seems like it's cursed, so I'm really scared...
I didn't bury it here. Go back into the house.
You're lying!
Crap! This cat means me harm, after all!
Deadly Queen!
I feel bad for you, but I'm going to blow you up with this.
First bomb, switch on!
What?!
Impossible! There's no way it can be a dud!
Is it because of this thing?
Huh? Is that a plant?
I told you to go back into the house!
Huh?
Shinobu!
The moment Deadly Queen's bomb moved away from that thing, it went off!
Could this thing's ability be...
"I'm going to kill that woman!"
I can't allow you to attack her anymore.
I'm going to have to make you disappear.
"Then I'll just have to kill this man who's getting in my way, too!"
The only time the bomb doesn't explode is when there's no air around it.
This plant instinctively knew just how it should kill him.
Could its Stand ability be the ability to control air freely?
It's coming!
I can't see it, but it released something again.
Deadly Queen!
It is releasing something. It's air!
You damn cat! I'll crush you!
I can't touch it!
It's like I'm stepping on an invisible balloon!
It really is controlling the air.
What?
Th-That thing...
I can't see it, but I'm sure it released an air bubble again.
This isn't good... Something isn't right!
What?
The cactus!
Sh-Shinobu!
What is this? Was I, Yoshikage Kira, just relieved
at the fact that the cactus needles didn't pierce her eyes?
What is this feeling?
Am I actually worried about someone else?
No!
I'm just worried that if this woman dies, Jotaro Kujo
That's the only reason I was relieved that she was okay.
That's all it is...
That attack won't work anymore.
It's just an ability that allows you to blow and spread air bubbles.
You are no longer a match for Deadly Queen.
What?!
Th-This thing just... put an air bubble into my veins!
It's rising higher and higher into my body!
I'm not that knowledgeable in medicine, but I've heard
it can block the vein and lead to death.
This is definitely more than 10cc!
Shit!
It's no use! This is bad...
I have no choice... I have to do it.
Deadly Queen!
I underestimated that thing.
Its ability to freely control the air...
It's a terrifying ability. Wh-What should I do?
It's coming! It's going to attack again!
What should I do?
That was close...
For now, I guess I'll let this go.
I'll let this go.

He told me yesterday that he buried that cat's corpse far away.
I suddenly fainted in front of him... It was so embarrassing.
But...
He took care of me, even though it made him late to work.
I was so happy.
It felt like our hearts were connected.
That was the happiest morning of my life.
Well? Is it good?
That Hayato...
Was that brat observing me?
Oh, darling!
That's my plate.
You don't like shiitake mushrooms, so I took them out of yours...
When did you start liking them?
You've already eaten more than half of it.
But I'm happy to see you gobbling down my cooking.
I guess you realized that you only thought you didn't like them, huh?
Yes.
All right, I'm going.
Have a good day, darling.
Jeez... I wanted him to give me a goodbye kiss.
But we're understanding each other's feelings.
I'll seduce him soon enough.
He was using a shoehorn to put on his shoes.
I'm sure he put on the 25.5cm sized shoes.
Having two different sizes of shoes is weird.
It's also weird that Mom and Dad are getting along lately.
He was even gobbling up the shiitake mushrooms that he hates.
This is weird, too.
Why was he writing his own name over and over?
And last night...
No matter how many times I see it, that's potting soil.
And I think the other thing he has is a bag of cat food.
And then he goes inside his closet...
They're all wearing hats.
Something doesn't feel right...
The attic?
Wh-What is that bizarrely shaped thing?
It's too dark for me to see it clearly.
There it is. It's that bag.
Huh?
Wha—
I-It's moving!
It's not a plant... Those are eyes!
It has eyeballs, and it's looking this way!
Could that cat food be for this thing?
Oh, darling.
What's the matter?
my goodbye kiss?
No...
Aww...
Why is he back?
Crap!
Huh?!
What?! Th-This thing...
like some kind of air bubble, has my arms and neck pinned down!
He's coming up! C-Crap!
The attic! I knew it! That brat...
I-It attacked me when I tried to shut the window?
Does this thing need sunlight to move?
I-I know! If they're air bubbles...
Yes! So it was the sunlight.
That noise...
Did Stray Cat wear itself out trying to
but I guess a tiny bit of light was coming in.
Still...
but it appears that it was, thankfully, just my imagination.
I would have had to kill him.
He has Dad's face, but that's not my dad. Who...
Wh-Who the hell is he?!

Yoshikage... My son...
Where are you right now?
I'm sure you've probably changed your face and name, and have hidden yourself.
How pitiful... And yet...
Right. We need to find out about any people who've gone missing recently.
Including those considered runaways.
Kira is probably hiding.
Do you think he'd commit murders again in that state?
Serial killers like him can't easily keep their impulses in check.
He will strike again.
Are you sure we don't need to do anything?
We haven't been able to find a single clue about Kira yet.
That's what I was thinking, too.
But Jotaro said it was fine.
but until then, he wants us to continue being students.
I'd rather look for Kira than study.
Kisara Drug
Yes. As long as I'm repairing my house, I'd like to do some renovations, too.
Curses! He's actually taking pictures of everyone to try to find him!
I guess I'll have someone come by to give me an estimate.
Jotaro and all of his other Stand users are doing whatever they want...
I need to make a new Stand user
Hm?
That's...
There's no doubt about it!
There's no way I would mistake my own son!
I've found you, Yoshikage...
I'm gonna find out
who the guy disguised as my dad really is.
It can't be...
At this rate, those Stand users will...
I won't allow it! I won't allow that to happen!
I will protect Yoshikage!

July 15th (Thurs), Part 1
July 15th (Thurs), 8:02 AM
So tired...
I stayed up way too late last night.
I got plenty of sleep, so I'm in top shape again today.
Look, Josuke.
Binoculars.
There's a pair of binoculars on the ground.
You're so easily intrigued by things that are on the ground.
Don't pick them up. They're dirty.
What? Really?
I am not dirty!
Hello, Josuke and Okuyasu.
I-It was you? Don't scare us like that, Mikitaka.
You're gonna give me a heart attack, damn it!
Oh, stop...
Don't get bashful. It's not a compliment!
Though, yeah... You showed up at a good time.
There's something I wanted to get straightened out.
The thing about you being an alien is a lie, right?
You're just a Stand user who thinks he's an alien, right?
Stop being ambiguous and clear things up, damn it!
I have been clear from the beginning.
I am an alien.
Why are you talking like that all of a sudden?
That's enough.
That thing?
That thing... The electrical pylon right in front of you.
Electrical pylon?
That's not really an electrical pylon.
What about it?
Are you trying to communicate with some other planet?
There's smoke coming out of the middle of that pylon, isn't there?
Huh?
Y-You're right...
Please take a good look at it.
H-Hey, it's a kettle!
What? In a place like that?!
It's, like, 20 meters off the ground!
Would you mind taking a look about five meters higher?
What the heck is that?
L-Let me see, too.
There! There he is!
There's a guy up there! He's cooking!
What?! Let me see!
He must be living on that pylon.
He's actually making a living there!
He's fishing from the river, and even has cucumbers growing.
That's really convenient!
I see! So it's basically a self-sufficient dwelling.
Some people in this world do very strange things.
Look out!
H-He's...
It's a new Stand user!
Yeah! I just saw him fly!
But what's a Stand user doing living up there?
It would seem there's a need to find out more about that man.
I can see them... They're finally here.
Are they interested in me?
Come on over.
It's been a while since I've spoken to other people.
Look. It looks like he sees us, too.
Want to go over there?
Yeah, but be careful.
July 15th (Thurs) 8:05 AM
Huh? D-Do you need something?
I'm in a bit of a hurry right... now...
Huh? Huh?!
July 15th (Thurs) 8:11 AM
Looking at it up close, it's bigger than I thought.
You guys, stop right there!
Huh?
Move back a bit more.
What are you talking about?
D-Don't tell me this is...
I told you so.
That's gross!
Gross? How rude!
I like to recycle everything I possibly can.
On the right are Asiatic dayflowers, mountain udo, and watercress.
They're all edible wildflowers!
So you really are living up there?
Doesn't this pylon belong to the electric company?
What are you talking about?
I bought this abandoned pylon for 100,000 yen
Bought?
For 100,000 yen?
That's right. Just 100,000 yen.
Because I'm self-sufficient, I don't have to work at any company.
And even if I never leave here, I get all the exercise I need by moving around the pylon.
Take a look at this spectacular view.
Huh? W-Wait a minute.
Even if you never leave? Just how long have you been living on this pylon?
Let's see... About three years now?
Th...
Three years?!
I probably haven't touched the ground in about a month.
H-Hey, Josuke. I had no idea that an idiot like this lived in Morioh.
This guy isn't an enemy, he's just a damn weirdo.
I don't think he's going to attack us.
True...
But...
Something's still bugging me...
July 15th (Thurs) 10:15 AM
What's he doing?
Well, I guess kids take videos, too...
He's following someone and recording their actions...
Could he be recording someone here?
Hayato Kawajiri
"Hayato Kawajiri," huh...
There's something strange...
about this kid.
July 15th (Thurs) 7:33 AM
I'm home.
Silence
That's strange.
Josuke, you haven't left for school yet?
Josuke!
I'm hungry.
Josuke, that bastard... This is so rude!
How dare he take a bite out of my favorite
Not to mention, there should have been two left.
That kid seriously pisses me off.
July 15th (Thurs) 8:14 AM
Hey, something fell out of your pocket.
Is that a photograph?
Would you guys mind leaving now?
You don't have to pick it up. I'll get it myself later.
It looks like a Polaroid. What's he panicking for?
Seriously, it's okay! Just leave!
What?! You're...
Hey! J-J-Josuke!
You're Kira's dad!
I knew the ghost dad was involved in this!
So you've finally come in. I've been waiting for this.
When you tell people to come in, they become guarded and don't come in.
But if you tell people not to come in, they get pissed off and come in.
You've finally stepped into Superfly, Josuke Higashikata!
Well done, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!
Well done luring that idiot Josuke into Superfly!
I commend you!
Something's not right! Come back, Josuke!
No, Kira's dad is right there! The arrow's right there!
You bastard!
Why, you—
What?!
they can't get out until the next person comes in.
That's my Stand, Superfly!
You fell for it, Josuke Higashikata!

I can finally leave, now that you guys have shown up.
Even I, its user, was held captive by Superfly.
Well, good luck living here in my stead!
That bastard!
Okuyasu, is there anything that I can do?
You'll just get hurt, so stay out of it.
Your job's over.
If you could actually turn into dynamite instead of
That I cannot do.
But I'd like to be of some use.
Shut up.
I'm telling you that there's nothing you can do.
Leave the dangerous stuff to us.
That bastard's starting to run away because he's convinced
but he must not know who we are.
Hey. You gonna do this, Okuyasu?
I know you're up to it, too.
What's the big deal about this pylon?
Yeah. There shouldn't be an issue if I crush it and get out!
Watch it!
The hell? What's with their power?!
This thing's pretty sturdy.
And look. It looks like that guy's about to fall off.
Y-You idiots! How can you do something so terrifying?
Of course I thought about that possibility.
But haven't you noticed?
This pylon is draining your powers and
Huh? What the hell is that idiot talking about?
Josuke, just a little more, and you'll be out of there!
Hold up, Okuyasu. Listen.
Something's not right. What's that weird sound?
It's the sound of all the power you guys threw
What?
And think about this carefully.
You know that whole "law of conservation of energy"?
Energy that's running around has to be able to escape from somewhere.
So where's all that energy's gonna go?
It can't be...
Okuyasu, duck!
What?!
If you hit it, it'll hit back. If you cut it, it'll cut back.
Just think about it.
no one can destroy this pylon!
Okuyasu!
Th-This isn't good, Josuke...
I couldn't dodge it completely.
It ripped a hole in my side.
I guess I should've warned you about that.
And next, you're probably going to think
But that's futile, too.
That's what Superfly is.
Josuke...
For eternity?
But don't get too depressed about that.
If one comes in, one can get out.
Just have some sucker take your place and get out.
It's sort of like playing Old Maid.
It's like human society.
Am I wrong?
Indeed, if someone else is pulled in, Josuke will be saved.
Huh?
What?
You should be the one to return, then. Into the pylon...
you go.
You...
Mikitaka! When did you...
Who the hell are you?
What the hell is that ability?
Why, thank you for asking.
You see, I'm an alien.
What?
Y-You actually can be useful!
Now's your chance. Please step outside, Josuke-san.
Y-You bastard!
You have my praise, Mikitaka!
Josuke, hurry up and get out.
R-Right...
I did it!
You bastard! What the hell?!
The guy in the photograph didn't tell me
I'm an alien, so I'm unaware of this game called "Old Maid,"
but to suddenly trick Josuke and tell him that he cannot leave...
It's like an adult beating a child at a game
This is why you should be the one to remain in the pylon.
You will remain here.
After all the time I spent living here, I ended up
There's a lot of stuff in here.
Take this!
but that is incorrect.
Yeah!
All right! Now, go to the top and come back out, Mikitaka!
You're the one who finally stepped into this pylon.
I'm a man who has thought of nothing but getting out of here every single day!
Did you forget?
That wire's also a part of this pylon!
The angle at which the wire was cut was made so it would return to you.
H-Have I been defeated?
M-Mikitaka! Hurry up and get out of there!
I can fix a wound like that!
Nope, he's not getting out.
The direction and angle are perfect.
If you strike it, it'll strike back.
Mikitaka!
Y-You bastard!
but now I can get out easily.
but you'll have plenty of time to treat it later.
There are some medicinal plants down there, too.
You bastard! Do you think you can escape just because you're out of there?
I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth, damn it!
Of course I can escape, and rather easily.
You guys haven't even been able to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?

Hello. My name is Kinoto. I'm the architect you called.
I came to estimate repairs from the fire and any renovations we might do.
Oh, right. We made plans for you to come by.
Heaven's Door!
Sorry that was so sudden, but I've been quite cautious lately.
Yay! I got work! Gonna make some money! Rohan Kishibe seems like he has a lot of money, so I'm gonna make a fortune. Hopefully I can overcharge a little bit.
He was born in 1970 and is a first-class architect.
I see.
Looks like he is indeed the one I called.
He's not a Stand user or an enemy.
Hm?
I don't like anyone looking at my back.
I don't want anyone to see my back. It's not like I have acne, scars, or a tattoo, but I never want anyone to look at my back, ever! I can't seem to get a girlfriend. What should I do?!
But it seems like he's safe to allow into the house.
Though there was that incident with the Janken kid, too...
Just in case, I'll write in that he can't attack me.
Huh? Did I do something just now?
No. Please, come in. Let's discuss the job.
Is something the matter?
If you don't come in, we can't discuss what to do about it.
Oh, please, go ahead. I'll follow you.
Huh?
Now, please, go ahead.
July 15th (Thurs) 9:06 AM
July 15th (Thurs), Part 2
Of course I can escape, and rather easily.
You guys haven't even been able to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?
You guys haven't seen my face.
I mean, it's Toyohiro Kanedaichi.
Wh-What the hell?
Are you wearing something over your face?
The fact that I thought about leaving here
means I also planned on getting away.
Well, I'll be leaving now.
Y-You bastard!
Please don't come in, Josuke.
I'll remain with this pylon.
What?! What the hell are you talking about?
and this happened because I turned into a wire
I can be useful, too.
Even though Okuyasu told me to stay out of it.
I got what I deserved.
Please don't worry about me.
You're pretty weird, but also brave.
Though it really doesn't matter to me who stays here.
As long as I get to leave, that's all that matters.
You guys can decide the rest for yoursel—
No, you're the one who'll be staying.
The only time you'll ever get to hear the word "goodbye"
is when you hear us say it!
J-Josuke!
Y-You bastard!
Since you cut this, I was able to fix it and climb back up here.
Impossible...
Mikitaka, could you hold on for another ten seconds or so?
After I beat the crap out of this guy
Don't fall, Josuke!
Of course I won't fall.
I just said "impossible," but that was wrong.
Let me rephrase that and say, "you fool."
All I wanted to do was leave this pylon.
But now I'm going to have to knock you off of here
Shut up!
Shining Diamond...
But do you really think you can
I'm guessing its range is about two meters.
Watch it!
Hey, you dumbass! Quit fooling around!
Josuke, move away from there!
It's already been cut with the knife!
He's already cut up the pylon!
That was a dirty trick!
But it's not a speed that my Shining Diamond can't dodge.
What are you smirking for, you bastard?
Are you that happy about me kicking your ass?!
I know every nook and cranny of this pylon.
I know exactly which angles to cut
I know it all too well!
Billiards?
Jo...
Josuke!
You said it wasn't a speed that Shining Diamond can't dodge, right?
But do you know which direction it's going to come from?
I wonder how many more shots it just fired.
They're reflecting off of the beams now.
Here they come!
Josuke!
It's coming from behind, too!
Josuke!
This is exactly why I said, "you fool."
That alien or whatever over there
You should have just listened to him.
Then you wouldn't have to die.
B-Both of his arms?
Here comes the energy to finish you off!
of this guy's attacks I smacked away with Shining Diamond?
Huh? Yeah, I saw.
What? Did you just say, "by the way"?
Four of them, huh? Well, that should be enough.
Four shots should be plenty.
What are you two talking about?!
You said they were reflecting.
You said the Stand's energy was reflecting like billiard balls to attack me.
What about it, Josuke?!
My Stand is Shining Diamond.
Fix... Did you say "fix"?
Are you saying that you actually had the chance to fix something just now?
You idiot!
You fixed the energies that were reflecting
and returned them to where they originated.
I-Impossible...
It looks like the line you were supposed to say was "impossible," after all.
I'm really sorry.
But the old guy in the photograph
and I ended up going along with it...
Please! Will you let me go back to this pylon?
I want to stay in here forever.
New Morioh landmark: the guy who lives on a pylon.
Morioh Landmark No. 9: The Guy Who Lives on a Pylon
he'll be happy and let you take pictures with him.
He's a bit shy, so he wears a mask
More importantly, about the old guy in the photograph...
Did he say anything?
Like where his son, Yoshikage Kira, might be, or anything else?
Is there a Stand user named Koichi here in Morioh?
What about Koichi?!
Listen, the old guy in the photograph just happened to randomly
I didn't ask too much about it, and he didn't go into detail.
Well, what did he say about Koichi?!
He said that he's been eliminated.
What?!
It seems the old guy in the photograph
and that he was going to start attacking, as well.
And this morning, a brand new Stand user eliminated a Stand user named Koichi...
That's all he said.
July 15th (Thurs) 10:58 AM
Hmm... This is rather...
Whoa! Th-This door will be about 800,000 yen!
And the design is from the Victorian and Edwardian eras!
It uses materials made in England, too...
This is going to cost quite a bit.
He said he didn't want anyone to see his back...
Was he acting like that on his way to my house, as well?
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Please, before it gets cold.
Oh, don't mind me.
July 15th (Thurs) 11:16 AM
I need to control myself...
Not yet...
Jo
Josuke
Josuke Higashi
Josuke Higashikata
July 15th (Thurs) 10:20 AM
I hope they're able to find Koichi safely...
July 15th (Thurs) 11:37 AM
or anywhere!
Koichi! Koichi!
Where are you, Koichi?!
I'm not giving up!
That's what's going on.
So I was wondering if you would use your sense of smell
Yuya Fungami.
I'll fix your injuries. This is a trade-off.
A trade-off?
You can't be serious, Josuke! Don't underestimate me!
You're the one who put me in this condition, and I'll never forgive you!
Do you think that my pride would actually allow me to help you?
I guess it's a no, after all.
Well, see you around. I don't have time to waste.
Wait, huh?! You're gonna back off that easily?
W-Wait a second, hey!
Come on, haggle with me a little more.
Okay, fine! I'll help you out!
Come on, now, jeez...
so I've got nothing against you.
So hurry up and fix me up, will ya?
These injuries are killing me!
I already fixed you up using Shining Diamond.
Huh?
You know...
I really am a hot, beautiful guy.
Saying that I resemble a Michelangelo sculpture would be putting it lightly.
But you know, I think my eyes are a bit droopier than before...
Can your Stand actually fix me up 100%?
Stop complaining!
Sniff
Sniff
Sniff
For example, I can tell that three girls are walking up the hall right now.
This smell is Reiko, Akemi, and Yoshie.
They're my groupies.
And I can also tell they're coming here from the pachinko parlor.
Yu! How are you feeling?
Ah, Yu! Yu is out of bed!
Yo.
Are you all better, Yu?
Yu!
There, there, my cute little kittens.
You're Josuke!
What the hell are you doing here?
Hey, stop. I have nothing against Josuke anymore.
More importantly, you guys were just playing pachinko, right?
Huh?
How did you know?
Your skirts reek of sweat around the ass.
The only reason you guys would sit on a vinyl chair
Akemi, you have chocolate?
You won at pachinko, didn't you?
You're right! You're amazing, Yu.
Here, these are for you.
I'm the man I am because of these girls.
You fixed my injuries, so I'll help you out.
You said you're not like a hunting dog?
You're more than that, Yuya Fungami!
July 15th (Thurs) 12:05 PM
What's the matter?
I'll give you an estimate, so please, go ahead.
What's with him?
Why does he go to such lengths to hide his back?
What's going to happen if I see it?
I-I want to see it!
Even if it means tricking him...
Oh, it itches... It itches...
But I can't quite reach it.
Would it be rude if I asked someone I just met to scratch my back?
That's fine...
July 15th (Thurs) 12:38 PM
This is it.
Koichi's house is less than two minutes away.
How did this new Stand user attack
No one saw him.
Josuke...
Our deal doesn't include me fighting, right?
You just want me to track, right?
I don't have to fight the enemy, right, Josuke?
Why are you asking that now?
You were already being followed.
It's that man.
I smell the same scent as Koichi from that man.
He has something of Koichi's on him!
What? That bastard over there?
Wait! Come back here!
You bastard! What did you do to Koichi?!
M-Mom?
Mom!
This is definitely my mom.
She's unconscious, but she's alive.
I was watching from here, but I couldn't tell...
When did he change into Josuke's mom?
but this is nothing like that!
Jotaro wouldn't be able to bring in a random person from nowhere!
I wouldn't have minded just knocking him out...
But that bastard went after my mom...
Guys like that are unforgivable!
Guys who play dirty tricks like this!
Yuya! Where is he?
then how would I know?
B-But he's still here, Josuke...
He's nearby. His scent hasn't cleared yet!
Hmm... Yuya Fungami, huh?
It's a bit surprising that his nose works that well.
Though I was fine with getting caught when I started following him, anyway.
I was planning on bringing out Josuke's mother, either way...
In order to observe Josuke.
Observe...
My Stand, Misterioso, observes.
Misterioso carefully observes Koichi Hirose and your mother, as well.
July 15th (Thurs) 7:37 AM
That kid seriously pisses me off.
I'll just eat his pudding, then!
Josuke! So you were still home.
You're here, right?
These are your panties
Everyone feels fear.
It's no use trying to hide your feelings or expressions of fear.
The fear that lies deep within one's heart
can never be erased...
No matter who you are.
Wh-Who are you? How did you get in here?
but you seem to have a habit of
Everyone shows some kind of subconscious sign when they're scared.
A habit displayed when they're truly scared...
Have you never realized it?
I'm asking you who you are!
I'm not giving you any money!
Do I look like a burglar to you?
After all, I'm having so much fun right now.
I'm having such fun with the attention you're giving me.
The fact that you're giving me attention out of fear, that is.
Gulp
Oh? You swallowed again, didn't you?
See? You just swallowed again!
That's definitely the sign that you're scared!
my Misterioso completes its invincible attack!
Tomoko Higashikata
as well as Koichi Hirose, into paper with ease!
Koichi Hirose
his sign of fear was blinking twice.
Yuya, I'm asking you where the scent is coming from!
No matter how tough Josuke is, I thought that he'd
Sure enough, I saw Josuke's sign.
Josuke definitely bites his lower lip when he's scared!
Ba-dump
Yuya, you keep looking at my mom.
Could it be...
Is it this jacket? Is there something inside the pockets?
I don't know what kind of Stand it is, but is it in this pocket?
Oh? Is he going to bite his lower lip?!
Come on, bite it!
Yuya, answer me! Is he in here?!
Damn! Looks like he's not scared yet.
Josuke, I didn't promise to help you fight.
I only promised I would track.
Going any further is way too dangerous.
but only a fool would put himself in danger after that.
I'm sorry, but that guy is too creepy!
Then I'll have to see for myself.
There's nothing in there. Both pockets are empty.
Other than this piece of paper...
The scent is no longer in the pocket...
Could it be...
Don't! If I were you, I wouldn't unfold that piece of paper!

There's nothing in there. Both pockets are empty.
Other than this piece of paper...
The scent is no longer in the pocket...
Could it be...
It's just a plain, white piece of paper.
What?!
Blam
J-Josuke!
July 15th (Thurs) 12:42 PM
p
Now you've done it!
I told you that the floor up here was burnt, too, didn't I?
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.
I-It's over... I'm finished...
H-Hey...
I'm already finished!
C-Calm down.
I'm sorry.
I just couldn't hold back my curiosity...
What?!
That's a Stand attack!
If there is, then even if I read him with Heaven's Door...
I see. No wonder there was nothing written.
This architect had already been attacked before he came here.
This architect was a victim
of the enemy Stand that's going to attack me.
Carry me on your back.
It's here! The enemy Stand is here!
Carry me on your back. Okay?
Carry me on your back.
On your back... Carry me on your back, okay?

These are all the people missing from Morioh, including runaways.
July 15th (Thurs), Part 3
These are all from after Kira disappeared, so there aren't that many.
So there's a possibility that Kira's victims might be among them.
I'm not sure about that, but the possibility exists.
What's important is to not miss any of his movements.

No matter what.

Carry me on your back, okay?
Heaven's Door!
Carry me on your back, okay?
What?! I-It can't be...
Has it possessed my back?
Did it transfer to me because I saw the architect's back?
Damn it!
Burn the pictures...
Hey, burn the pictures.
Pictures?
Burn them, okay? Burn away those pictures...
What are you talking about?
The pictures I took...
Could it be there's one among them
and you're here to get rid of it?
Just burn all of them, okay? Burn them away, okay?
Shut up!
Heaven's Door!
Let's see...
Ow!
What?!
I'm a Stand that was born when
But my user now is you, Rohan Kishibe.
You're my user now.
Wha?!
Do you get it?
You get that? Okay?
I'm a Stand with a will of my own.
Do you get it? Okay? Do you get it?
Do you get it? Okay?
My ability is to just whisper to people.
Okay? If you get it, burn the pictures.
You bastard... Get away from me!
Damn it! Why, you...
That's easy. You just have to show someone else.
If you show someone your back...
Okay? I'll go away and transfer over there.
You just have to show someone.
Hello, Rohan-sensei!
I always read your manga.
A nude girl!
Bye!
Burn the pictures, okay?
July 15th (Thurs) 12:47 PM
Josuke!
H-He wasn't shot.
Y-You asshole!
Shining Diamond, eh?
That was scary, right? Bite it, Josuke Higashikata.
Bite your lower lip.
Are you gonna bite it?!
Bite it! Come on, just bite it and show me your sign!
So this is his Stand?
Not going to bite it yet, I see...
Looks like he's covering up his fear with anger.
I guess I have no choice. I'll have to show myself.
You've got some nerve, you asshole!
This is it... This creepiness.
He's been hiding all this time, so why is he coming out now?
He showed up on purpose.
He's dangerous... He's too dangerous, Josuke!
True... My Stand's ability might be a crappy one.
But if I were to explain my ability to you...
I can make various things
into paper and file them away, and it's extremely useful.
And this paper is Koichi Hirose.
You bastard... So that's where you were hiding Koichi!
That's Koichi's scent.
He didn't have something of Koichi's... He had Koichi himself!
He's alive, of course, because my Stand ability is a crappy one.
I don't have the power or ability to kill someone.
Though that's not the case if someone rips it up, like I did just now.
I'll let you off the hook with just an ass-kicking
if you bring Koichi back here right now.
Just try and get him...
If you can.
Koichi Hirose
Koichi!
Because my Stand ability is a crappy one.
I don't have the power or ability to kill someone.
Though that's not the case if someone rips it up.
That's the trap!
Josuke, ignore it.
You bit it! You finally bit it!
Misterioso was waiting for this moment, Josuke Higashikata!
It was waiting for the moment you bit your lip!
You bastard...
You showed your sign of fear!
you're powerless before Misterioso.
Thud
I feel bad for Josuke, but I'm glad I didn't help him.
If I had helped him, that guy would have probably
Do you understand now that there's no power
Wh-What?
That metal rod is fixed...
That paper there
I knew it was just bait with the name "Koichi Hirose" written on it.
That's because the only reason you were confident enough to show yourself
and it's because he's alive that you can threaten me.
I knew that piece of paper was a trap...
It was, wasn't it?
But the reason I still tried to save that piece of paper
was because there was still a possibility that it was Koichi.
then my only choice is to try to save him!
Misterioso, you win.
However, let me just warn you of one thing...
If I'm able to come back from this, I will kill you!
L-Look at you, talking big...
You weren't a big deal at all.
Koichi Hirose
Yuya Fungami, huh?
Not helping out Josuke was a very smart thing to do.
I could have gotten rid of you easily.
Your sign of fear is to poke at your chin with your fingers.
so I guess you get to stay alive.
That's the smart thing to do.
Want to hear something interesting about this paper?
Anyone can take out what's inside if they open it.
It's a very simple thing to do, but it's quite hard for someone who's in fear.
To Morioh Grand Hotel.
All right! We got rid of Koichi Hirose and Josuke Higashikata!
Right about now, Rohan Kishibe should also be...
July 15th (Thurs) 2:21 PM
Which is it?
Which picture has something to do with Yoshikage Kira?
Which picture is the old man in the photo trying to get rid of?
Burn them, okay? Burn them.
It's no use...
So let's burn the pictures, okay?
Shut up! You're annoying!
Damn it! I have to let them know...

Er, that was Morioh Grand Hotel, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Are you spending the night?
No, there's a lot there, so...
A lot there, indeed...
No...
You won't be going to Morioh Grand Hotel.
Josuke, you bastard! Trying to play it cool...
If, just if, as stupid as this is, if the one turned into paper
Letting you or Yoshikage Kira live in this town would be totally uncool.
Hand over Koichi!
What you're doing right now isn't the smart thing to do.
So you're saying that you want to fight me?
You're saying that you're going to make Kira's dad your enemy?
Very well!
63, 64, 65 kilometers...
Though it lacks power, my Highway Go Go will never stop its pursuit.
The taxi stopped...
Even though it's not at the hotel yet.
No one's gotten out of the taxi yet.
His scent is emanating strongly from the car...
But where is he? Where is he hiding?
The scent of this paper...
There's no doubt about it!
This paper smells like Koichi and Josuke!
Wait, Highway Go Go! Don't open the door just yet.
That bastard is underestimating me.
So he's trying to lure me in, huh?
Very well, I accept!
I said I would do it!
He's after my fear.
How is he going to try to scare me?
I need to find that out.
What? What is this piece of paper stuck in the door?
Underestimating me again. This scent...
This piece of paper is the trap.
Open the door, Highway Go Go.
Foom
To think he can turn flames into paper, too...
But I saw through the trap!
But I smell something other than Josuke and Koichi...
This looks dangerous to just go ahead and open.
What is this?
A scent I've never smelled before is moving around.
It's faint, but it's moving inside the paper...
What?!
Crap! Highway Go Go!
Wh-What is this liquid?
I-Is it some kind of chemical?
W-Wait...
C-Calm down. What he's after is my fear.
If he manages to scare me, he wins.
Iron...
Damn it!
I have no choice but to open it!
Josuke! Koichi!
Koichi Hirose
Josuke Higashikata
Th-That's an electrical current.
The smell of machinery that I could smell from this paper was...
A...
It won't turn off!
Josuke and Koichi are getting sucked in!
Damn it! Highway Go Go!
I-It's no use.
Josuke! Koichi!
You finally touched it, Yuya Fungami.
You finally got scared and touched your chin...
It was so easy to scare you, Yuya Fungami!
There's no one that Misterioso can't turn into paper!
No matter who it is, it can do it easily!
Easy? That's why it's so great!
It turns anyone into paper instantly...
That's why it's great!
I lost. You really freaked me out.
But I'll gladly declare my defeat.
What did you just pull out?!
Don't you dare open up that piece of paper!
I'll gladly turn into a piece of paper.
Josuke Higashikata
Koichi Hirose
Yuya Fungami... You're...
actually sorta cool, after all.
Josuke Higashikata... Koichi Hirose...
S-Stay back, Josuke! Look at this paper!
I-I'll rip it!
Act 3! 3 Freeze!
S-So heavy...
Let's see, what was it?
Oh, that's right. I remember.
That's right... I definitely said that.
I said I would never forgive guys like you, right?
Guys like you
W-Wait a minute!
I just liked observing other people getting scared!
I just recently got this Stand, so I got cocky.
I-I apologize. I feel really bad.
There's something I realized after watching you...
Huh?
You have a habit of closing one eye when you get scared, don't you?
That's a habit, right?
But...
When you're even more scared, you close both.
You like observing? Then keep doing it.
Quietly and calmly keep observing.
I-I'm a book...
If you give the staff the title "Misterioso,"
When reading this book, you sometimes feel like you can hear a voice.
Well, that's that.

Maybe this means that we're getting closer to Yoshikage Kira.
Though we don't know anything.

Rohan-sensei?
Where...
Over here, Koichi.
Rohan-sensei!
What's wrong? You wouldn't explain anything over the phone...
I'd like you to help me.
I'm being attacked by an enemy Stand.
What?!
A S-Stand? Where is it? Where?!
It's on my back. It's possessed my back.
Your back?
Um... Your back is being attacked?
Yes. It's a very dangerous Stand. I'm not sure what I should do.
Could you show it to me?
I cannot.
But if you don't show it to me...
If I show it to you, it'll kill me and transfer over to you!
Hurry up and burn them, okay?
See? It's talking! It's this thing, Koichi!
Huh?
Why are you hiding it?!
Did you call me over here just to mess with me?
What are you talking about?!
I already told you. If I show you my back, I'll die!
But you're always messing with me, Sensei.
So that is what's going on.
No! I'm being serious right now!
There's a corpse upstairs!
Huh? A c-corpse?!
Um... What are you doing, Sensei?
Climb over me, and go ahead.
Please, please, go ahead. Please!
Seriously, what's with you?
Well? Do you believe me now?
It's gone!
That's impossible...
Right here, Koichi!
Look, Koichi! This is Masazo Kinoto!
He had the life sucked out of him, and he dried up!
Wow, that's amazing. You did a great job making that.
But this is no time to be joking around, Sensei!
The Stand users made by the old man in the picture are really after us.
So I rushed over here, thinking that something might've happened to you, too!
What?
Then this thing...
Anyway, just be careful.
Bye.
W-Wait, Koichi!
I asked you to come because I knew those shitbags
Josuke and Okuyasu wouldn't believe me!
You have to believe me! We're friends, aren't we?!
Koichi!
Don't be down, okay? Even though this has gotta hurt...
I, Rohan Kishibe, have never faced such humiliation...
You bastard. You'll regret this...

Congratulations. You get to live longer. I'll hold off on picking you right now.
Until I can completely blend into Kosaku Kawajiri's lifestyle.
my dad, like, totally follows me in secret, or comes snooping around.
You're going out at night too much.
And whose fault is that?
I got super pissed off, so I totally stole something in front of him on purpose.
And then I went straight to your place.
Seriously? They've probably got the cops looking for you now.
Hey... What are you touching my bag for?
What's wrong?
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.
What are you, a pickpocket? A groper? What a joke.
Morioh. Morioh.
Oh, crap! This is Morioh.
Come on, we're getting off.
Ow...
What the hell?
Watch where you're going when you get off the train!
Hey, did you see that? He had a bowling pin nail clipper.
A bowling pin nail clipper, in this day and age... What a geek.
July 15th (Thurs) 5:07 PM
Do you have the pictures?
Hey, where are you going with the pictures?
Morioh Grand Hotel. That's the only place I can go now.
To where Jotaro is? It doesn't matter where you go, okay?
Just give up and burn the pictures.
Well done...
Even though you don't know who could be watching from which window.
This is dangerous.
There, you see? Every street has an intersection.
See? There's no way you can cross.
Someone will see your back for sure.
The road's just going to get wider, and there will be even more people.
So let's just not go! Okay?
There's no way you can cross.
You think so?
Masazo Kinoto came all the way to my house.
He must have crossed an intersection, as well.
I just have to figure out how he crossed it.
And he did it... like this!
Stick
This is ridiculously embarrassing, but I can make it to the station this way.
Yeah, not bad, Rohan Kishibe.
But you've forgotten something.
When Masazo Kinoto was crossing, I didn't interfere with him!
Hey, jackass! Why are you walking so slow?
The hell did you say?!
See?
Er, hey! Turn around!
What?!
You're the one forgetting something, Cheap Trap.
Masazo Kinoto didn't have this...
He didn't have Heaven's Door!
Cannot turn around for one minute.
What?!
All right. Now I should have no problem walking so that no one sees my back.
You'd better be prepared, you bastard.
Wh-What?
There's no way you're going to make it.
You're the one who's going to die with your dick all shriveled up.
Just keep running your mouth.
Your only ability is to talk. And that's been sealed.
Wh-Wh-Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!
July 15th (Thurs) 5:32 PM
Looks like there aren't any big intersections for a while.
Hey, can you use your Heaven's Door ability on animals, too?
Yeah, if the animal has any intelligence.
So that means if an animal sees your back, I can transfer over to them, too!
Even easier than humans, huh?
True. I have to be careful of these guys, too.
I hate cats.
They glare at you.
Hey, move!
What?! It can't be...
So one of these guys just has to glance at your back, right?
My ability is only to speak.
But, you see, humans aren't the only ones that I can talk to.
I'm the one who called them here.
They hate you.
I just told them that you love killing cats and dogs!
Get him!
Heaven's Door!
I-It's no use! There are too many!
I won!
3 Freeze!
These animals didn't do anything wrong.
So scram, all of you. Shoo.
Th-That Stand is...
Koichi!
What?!
and you were still acting weird, Rohan-sensei.
and crossing the street with your back to someone else's, all by yourself.
So you really do have an enemy Stand on your back.
That's exactly what I admire so much about you...
You truly are my friend.
It's on your back, right?
I just have to remove the enemy from your back, right?
Reverb, 3 Freeze!
Heavy...
Y-You did it!
Aren't you a bit naïve?
I'm not sticking to your back with strength, but with my ability.
Trying to forcibly remove me from your back
means that you'll destroy your back.
Thud
Huh?!
Go ahead and tell Koichi, okay? Hurry up and tell him!
R-Rohan-sensei?!
K-Koichi...
I'm very moved that you came here, and very grateful...
But I'd appreciate it if you'd withdraw Act 3.
You can't see it, but my back is starting to rip ever so slightly...
Act 3! Undo the 3 Freeze!
S-h-i-t. Understood.
R-Rohan-sensei! A-Are...
Of course I'm not okay, Koichi Hirose!
This damage is your fault, isn't it?
Do you get it now? There's no way to get rid of me.
means that you'll be peeling away your own back!
Hey...
You're just going to wear yourself out.
or you'll go crazy and kill yourself...
they can't defeat me if my only ability is to talk!
Okay?
The Stand on your back... Just what kind of...
Large Vehicles Cannot Pass Through
What kind? Do you want to see?
You want to see what kind of Stand it is?
Fine...
I'll show it to you.
R-Rohan-sensei...
Looks like you've finally lost it!
I guess you finally realized it's no use going to Jotaro, either!
Jotaro?
I wasn't heading there in the first place.
I was heading here.
I was so happy to finally make it here
that I couldn't help but laugh.
What are you yammering about?
You finally showed your back to someone!
I'm now going to possess Koichi Hirose!
Th-This place... That post box...
Cheap Trap, you turned around here.
because of your ability, you had no choice but to look Koichi's way.
Wh-What?!
The alley where Reimi is, where you can't turn around, no matter what!
you'd return the damage to me.
But there was something that could grasp only you...
Something that'll only take those who look back.
Something that'll only take your soul!
Let go! Okay? Let go!
Where do you think you're taking me?! Hey!
The afterlife.
but just in case, I'll write it in for you.
Going to Hell
It wouldn't do anything except talk, but that was one intense Stand.
I wouldn't have made it here, and it would have killed me.
I had no idea we'd end up here.
Reimi!
Did you take these pictures, Rohan?
I did.
Something bothers me about them...

So, like, Mika
got her boyfriend to buy her some expensive brand earrings.
Buy some for me, too!
Next time.
What do you think you're doing in my apartment?!
Hey, get the hell out!
Hm... A one-room apartment...
I am Yoshikage Kira. Would you be kind enough to tell me your name?
My nails are quite long, aren't they?
Look how long they are.
Is there anyone who can actually stop their nails from growing?
There isn't.
you cannot stop the destiny you were born with.
I believe I asked for your name...
M-My boyfriend... What did you do to my—
Don't answer a question with a question!
Didn't they teach you in school not to answer a question with a question?!
I'm asking you what your name is!
M-Minako! M-M-Minako!
Minako...
Your parents gave you a beautiful name.
I like it.
Minako, I have a request.
It would make me happy if you would hold these.
I want you to cut my nails with these geeky nail clippers.
You've never cut someone else's nails?
There's a first time for everything.
Be careful not to cut them too short.
Help... Please...
Help... Forgive me...
Forgive you?
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not angry or anything.
This is something I enjoy.
I chose you because you suited my taste, as well.
I was born with these tastes, so I'm just trying to act positively about it.
Positively...
It sounded like you were asking your boyfriend for some earrings.
Here, he left these for you.
It's a present.
You're very good at cutting nails. I like that about you, too.
And you are truly adorable when you don't talk.
What to do, Minako...
but bringing you into the Kawajiri home would be risky.
Still, this is refreshing... This is truly refreshing!
Th-The man and woman he followed from the station...
He killed them and made them disappear!
That's... Hayato.
What is he doing in a place like this?
This is the opposite direction from the house and his school...
What's that?
I didn't lock the door...
Hayato... He...
It couldn't be.
He's not human... What is that thing that's disguised as my dad?
There's evidence that they've been back here.
And there are blood stains on the floor.
Did he finally make his move?
July 15th (Thurs) 8:36 PM
The thing in Hayato's hand was definitely a handy cam.
It doesn't seem to be in this room right now...
Hayato...
He's been acting weird ever since the other day.
I have to find out what Hayato was doing.
I have to find out for sure.
C-Calm down...
I have to calm down and gather my thoughts.
First, this videotape...
Should I show it to someone?
I can't show it to Mom!
Mom totally trusts him.
Should I show it to the police?
Would they believe that a person got blown up and then disappeared?
More importantly, he's not human...
Could the police even catch someone like him?
No... Does anyone even exist in this world who could catch him?
What should I do?
Mom and I are going to be killed eventually.
What am I supposed to do?!
Do you mind if I join you...
in the bath, Hayato?
It's been a while.
I-I'm gonna head out now.
Oh, come on.
We're family, after all...
Wh-What does he want?
I'll be in trouble if he finds this tape.
I'm sorry, Hayato, but could you let go of the bucket?
I want to draw some water and wash my body.
I-I'll wash your back for you, Dad!
That's a great idea.
But I'll wash your back first.
You're the one who got in first. I'll wash yours first, then we can switch.
Now, sit down.
What's the matter? You seem to be sweating quite a bit.
Did you get get too hot?
Y-Yeah...
Then why are you shivering?
Isn't it strange to shiver if you're overheated?
You're tickling me, Dad!
You should know that I've always been ticklish!
You're... right.
You've always been ticklish, Hayato.
I-I'll wash my front...
I see. So you'll do it yourself.
By the way, I just remembered...
and I saw you.
Huh?!
With a video camera!
What were you doing?
Now I know for sure!
This little brat was watching!
This is awful... I thought I'd peacefully fit into this household...
I've had nothing but misfortune this year.
What an awful year.
Killing this brat will draw attention to myself, and that would be very bad.
But since he saw that, I have no choice!
I just turned one of the strands of this brat's hair into a bomb.
it'll just look like he slipped and hit his head on the bath.
That's a common accident in our society.
You're going to die.
Die, brat!
Are you going to kill me, too?
Even though I've got video of you...
I'm even videotaping you right now!
What?
I've been suspicious of you this whole time.
Your different shoe size
and the fact that you were practicing your signature are all on tape!
I've got other tapes, too!
I even took a video of the cat-like plant you've got in the attic!
I'm the only one who knows where the tapes are!
But if something were to happen to me, I'm sure someone would find that place.
What?
Don't you dare lay a finger on me! Got it?
You little shit! You dare threaten me?
I won't let you touch my mom, either!

July 15th (Thurs) 8:30 PM
This isn't good... This isn't good at all!
I need to let Yoshikage know!
Reimi!
You took this picture, Rohan?
Yes, why?
This one is marked. Is there something wrong with it?
The one you have circled looks a little boy.
Hayato Kawajiri
Oh, him...
It's nothing, really.
But this boy, Hayato Kawajiri, has the same last name as this man here.
Huh? Really?
Look!
Kosaku Kawajiri
It's the same.
They do have the same last name.
At this rate, Rohan Kishibe will find his way to Yoshikage!
July 15th (Thurs) 8:48 PM
Hayato? Hayato!
Ugh...
Hayato, I've been calling you!
D-Darling...
I thought it was Hayato in the bath.
I mean, look at this!
Hayato left his clothes in the hallway as if they exploded off of him.
Unlike you, no matter how many times I warn him, he's such a slob.
And he's not answering me again.
I'm sure he's probably got his headphones on, reading manga again.
Oh! Darling, your fingers are bleeding.
What happened?
I-I'll do it myself.
I can apply a bandage myself.
I just got my fingers caught in the door, that's all.

July 15th (Thurs) 8:50 PM
Hayato Kawajiri?
Are you saying this grade-schooler has something to do with Yoshikage Kira?
Bites the Dust, Part 1
True, there's something wrong if he's secretly taking videos of his dad.
So, tomorrow morning, we're thinking of meeting up
and going to visit Hayato Kawajiri's house.
Apparently, Rohan-sensei's already found the address.
That bastard Rohan sure works fast.
All right. I just have to invite Okuyasu, right?
And of course, there's Jotaro, too.
I'll talk to Jotaro.
All right. See you tomorrow at 8:30 AM
Got it.
8:30, huh? I'm gonna be late for school.
But if we talk to this kid, we might find something out.
Are you okay?
And you look pale.
I told you, it's nothing.
Can you blame me for being pale?
More importantly, can you make me some tea?
I'll be down soon.
Of course.
but lately, I can't help but think that you're immortal.
I'll go make you that tea now.
If something happens to me, your secret's going to be found out!
Don't you lay a finger on me or my mom!
This isn't a deal!
You're too naïve!
I can't believe you actually got rid of Hayato.
I'm trying to think of what to do right now.
It's no use thinking about it.
That Rohan Kishibe has started investigating Hayato Kawajiri.
but they're coming to check this house tomorrow.
It's a bad idea to stay in this house any longer.
Shut up. I'm thinking right now.
Ever since you were a child, when things didn't go your way
and there was nothing you could do, you would always bite your nails.
You poor thing.
There's no other way around it.
If you go now, you can escape to someplace they can't follow you, before they find out.
Are you telling me to flee Morioh?
having to worry about someone coming after me!
I will never leave this town.
What?!
The arrow acted on its own! I didn't do anything!
I didn't even touch the arrow!
Th-The arrow...
Y-Yoshikage!
Hayato! Hayato?!
July 16th (Fri) 7:30 AM
Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?
Hurry up and wake—
What, you're already awake? That's a surprise.
Hayato, breakfast is ready.
I couldn't sleep very well last night.
He... He found out that I saw him kill someone.
Anyway, I made sure that he wouldn't be able to lay a finger
What should I do now?
I-I don't understand... What happened, Yoshikage?
You've been acting strange since last night.
Listen to me, Yoshikage!
That Rohan Kishibe has started investigating Hayato Kawajiri for some reason!
They're going to come check this house tomorrow.
There's no need to worry.
B-But, Yoshikage!
Deadly Queen has gained a third ability.
I... I don't understand.

What? No way! We're on the air already?
Er, um... It's now 7:55, so here's the weather today for the prefecture.
Today should be sunny.
Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.
After that bath last night, he changed.
Wh-What could have happened?
Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!
h
My precious tea set!
This is all your fault!
Fine! You think your mother's just a bother, right?!
Do whatever you want, then!
Now, now. Let's not fight first thing in the morning.
If it broke, I'll just buy you another one.
Hello, Kawajiri residence.
No, it's not.
Hayato's just at an age where he doesn't want to talk much.
We're family, so we all need to get along.
You know, get along.
Well, I'll head off to work now.
Do you mind if I give you a goodbye kiss?
Huh?
I'll be off now.
H-He left...
No, I'm right here.
Why don't we walk together part of the way?
Going from feeling refreshed to falling into despair...
So much has happened lately. I've been on an emotional roller coaster.
But now I'll be able to feel at ease.
Since you cornered me last night, I was able to mature.
Really, your will last night was so strong.
To think that you would actually turn around and threaten me, Yoshikage Kira...
Y-Yoshikage Kira?
Did I just say my real name?
A-Are you planning to kill me after all?
Kill you?
Because you found out my secret?
There's no need for that. Because I've matured.
it doesn't matter, because now, none can rival me.
I have no interest in you anymore. If I wanted to kill you...
I would have gotten rid of you last night.
From now on, we're all going to get along and live happily together.
So just relax... Like we're family.
Well, I have to head to the station.
Rival... He just said none can rival him...
Which means there must be others
But what's with that creepy confidence?
If he's unrivaled now, does that mean he's gained some other abilities?
What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?

July 16th (Fri) 8:24 AM
I've been waiting for you.
There's something that I wanted to ask you out of curiosity.
It's about this picture.
This is you, right?
Were you taking video of your dad in the corner there?
Wait.
What... is this?
Well, I know that was sudden...
But it's much faster to just read
and I can get honest answers this way, too.
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
What Heaven's Door turns into a book
should just be the memories of this boy's life experiences, without any falsehoods.
And yet... a warning?
[Warning] You mustn't read any further.
Is this "warning" what he experienced?
but now this has definitely caught my interest.
[Warning] You mustn't read any further.
"You mustn't read any further"?
Who in the world could this warning be for?
An old guy walked by with his fly down.
He sneezed and said, "Damn it."
Some women laughed at him.
Wh-What is this?
This is getting even more confusing.
Damn it.
J-Just who is this boy?
It rained.
Ugh, the forecast didn't say it was going to rain!
At 8:27 AM, lightning struck above the Pepsi sign.
8:27...
Wh-Who in the world is this Hayato Kawajiri?
Why is he experiencing things in the future?
Could he be a Stand user?
No... This is too odd to be a Stand ability.
All I can read with Heaven's Door
is what he has personally seen or heard.
The answer to this should be written somewhere...
My dad isn't my dad
He made a man and a woman disappear at an apartment in Jozenji by making them explode.
He's a murderer. I found out who he was. He has inhuman abilities.
My dad's name is Yoshikage Kira

"Rohan Kishibe was also killed"?
He was killed by Kira, who had matured.
Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.
Heaven's Door!
Rohan Kishibe, Deadly Queen is already inside your eye!
That is what you are seeing!
The switch for Deadly Queen's third bomb
has already been activated!
Deadly Queen's third ability...
It is a bomb to blow away anyone who tries to come after me!
It will activate in anyone who tries to get close to Hayato in order to learn about me.
He was killed by Kira, who had matured.
Rohan Kishibe was also killed.
and if he writes it down, it'll activate immediately.
Which means it's a bomb I implanted in Hayato!
Koichi is coming. I have to tell him...
I... I finally... found him...
Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri.
I found him with my Heaven's Door.
I have to tell...
Koichi...
this is the real third ability of Deadly Queen!
K-Koichi!
I-It was a dream?
I couldn't sleep very well last night.
I kept having these weird dreams...
Hayato!
Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?
Hurry up and wake—
What, you're already awake?
Hayato, breakfast is ready.
D-Didn't this...
What? No way! We're on the air already?
Th-This morning TV program...
Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.
Th-This isn't a dream...
What I just saw wasn't a dream.
Th-This is the same morning.
It's repeating...
Today's morning is repeating again!
Yoshikage Kira... His name is Yoshikage Kira!
He's doing this!
and he planted that inside me!
Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!
Oh, yeah!
Look out—
Ow...
That was a nice catch. It was almost as if you knew it was going to fall.
But if you can hear me, you could at least answer!
Hello, Kawajiri residence.
Huh? No, it's not.
It appears I'm the only one in the world who's aware
It's almost as if you knew, huh?
Apparently you blew someone up and came back, Hayato.
No, really. I don't know exactly what you've done.
and it automatically protects me...
from inside you, Hayato.
Did you know that I already killed you once last night?
As though as it was trying to remedy
I gained a brand new ability.
and the fact that I killed you disappeared.
At the same time, you became a bomb to protect me.
You told someone about me and the bomb activated, and then you came back.
Who did you blow away, hm? Come on, tell me.
Who did you kill?
I-I didn't tell anyone...
I see! Then someone must have been asking you questions.
It must be that Rohan Kishibe.
as soon as someone asks you about me, Bites the Dust will activate.
And then you will blow him up and come back.
The very fact that Rohan Kishibe encountered you has disappeared!
That is Deadly Queen Bites the Dust.
You won't be able to tell anyone.

Yeah, the repair bill will go through the roof.
That's not it! You shot a man!
A man?
You mean Straizo?
What's going on?
Smokey, run outside!
I hope what I shot was only a man.
If he was, time in jail is the worst that'll happen to me.
I-I don't understand.
Calm yourselves! I can't hear anything!
Get out now or I'll French kiss you!

What in the world? So this is a vampire!
Dio's failure was overindulgence in playing with his powers.
He wanted to experiment with their limits.
That made an opening for Jonathan to strike.
But my philosophy is different.
I'll find the extent of my powers after I've destroyed you.
I'll show you no mercy!
And I'll start with the technique that Dio used to kill Jonathan!
Out of ammo?
My eyes can fire high-pressure essence.

Now you'll say, "It will be easier than drowning an infant."

H-How can he live with a hole in his head?!
Too much time in a backwater like Tibet isn't good for you.
Life in the city makes you strong.
You could've won if you were a bit more observant.
Take a good look at the face of that clock!
I was told my grandpa was taken down
A mirror?!
So you finally noticed, Straiz-oaf!
I also heard that you're as allergic to Hamon as you are to sunlight!
I'll knock you out of the park!
Shoot!
Let's see, now. I hear Hamon melts vampire faces.
Now we find out.
H-He's fine!
It's like nothing happened!
Was Granny wrong?
No, you would grow into a deadly foe if left unchecked for too long.
A secret before you die.
There is an insect in Southeast Asia called the Satiporoja beetle.
30,000 of their tiny stomachs were dried and woven into this scarf.
It conducts Hamon far better than the human body, dispersing it.
It's like an electrical ground.
I am the successor of 4,000 years of history in the art of Hamon.
I know all its strengths and weaknesses in battle.
Wow, that's really something!
But do you think I'd rely on gimcracks like Hamon alone?
I'm also fast!
He put a grenade in my scarf! How?!
A pitiful trick!
You should've spent time in the city!
Take a look at the grenade you knocked away!
You son of a...!
I-I got him!
W-What the heck is he?!
Smokey, don't look!
Too late!
God, I won't do anything bad again!
I won't steal or anything else! Just save me!
H-He's a monster.
D-Do you have a way to beat a monster like this, JoJo?
Yeah, I do.
Really? You do?
Yeah, I have one last card up my sleeve.
One last card? W-What is it?
I saved this one for last.
Look at his legs.
They were blown to smithereens and haven't healed yet.
That's our ticket.
A-And your last card?
I'll use my own legs.
Use your legs? How?
To hotfoot it out of here, Smokey!
Outta the way!
I can't believe this guy!
Follow me, Straizo!
Wait up, JoJo!
Even if I am immortal, it will take a lot of energy to regenerate after that.
All right! What a scoop! The papers will eat this up!

We should be safe now, right?
I'm afraid not, Smokey. Listen.
Listen to what?
Oh, the river?
Wrong! Look up!
H-Help!
He came after us! Run for it!
This woman is my hostage!
If you run, I'll kill her!
If you come up here, I'll let her go.
What are you thinking?
I don't even know that woman, moron!
Let's run, JoJo!
This is a test!
If you flee now, I'll know what sort of man you are.
I need time to heal and will not pursue you.
You would not seek revenge for Speedwagon.
You would pose a great threat to me in the future.
I would have to eliminate you here and now!
In five seconds, I will kill her!
Climb up or run! Decide now!
I wouldn't fight for a hag like that, even if she was my sweetheart!
I'll kill her by pulling down on her lower jaw.
I'll tear right through her neck and into her chest.
Would a master of Tibetan Hamon really do
A-A tooth! He ripped out her tooth!
That bastard! He really did it!
I'll show no mercy!
You fiend!
Straizo!
You'll pay for that!
You're inhuman to the core!
You pretend to be cool, but you're full of fire inside.
I'll demolish you, Straizo!
Taste this!
I can beat that move now!
I won't fall for the same tired old stunt twice!
Hamon!
Im--
"Impossible," you say?
Impossible!
I deflected your shot with Hamon glass!
I knew you'd aim for my forehead.
It was easy to intercept.
Apologize to Speedwagon in hell!
You'll sleep soundly tonight, Granny.
Why save me from falling?
I might still have enough power to blow your arm off.
Shut up and do it, then! I'll just punch you with the other!
I want an answer.
Something is fishy.
Joseph, your grandfather Jonathan's blood flows strongly in you.
Outside you are opposites, but you're both insatiably curious.
And now I warn you that your nature has
What do you mean?
Soon you'll learn of the Pillar Man.
Soon you'll meet the Pillar Man!
Don't feed me any of your nonsense!
I threw the bodies into the river because of him.
The pillar sucked blood from the bodies in the cave.
It was like a plant drawing up nutrients.
It was ghastly.
So I dragged the bodies outside.
But I am sure he will awaken soon from his 2,000-year slumber.
Joseph, you will meet him soon.
Soon you'll learn the truth of him and meaning of evolution.
Your destiny is already written!
Hamon?!
That means you're creating Hamon inside your own body!
I regret nothing.
I want to go to hell feeling full and young rather than withering away.
Being young again was a supreme joy for me!
Straizo, wait! I need to know more!
Farewell, JoJo!
JoJo...
1938, the year that the Second World War began to engulf the planet.
The German army sought to conquer all. Their weapons were cutting-edge.
They used astrology, sorcery, alchemy and psychic powers.
Every tool available was employed in their bid for world domination!
Their spy network in Mexico
Mexico
caught wind of Straizo's actions.
I-I'm terribly sorry, Major von Stroheim!
M-My hand slipped!
Lick.
You cut me, right? Now lick my wound clean.
Yes, sir.
Don't make it hurt. Gently, now.
Slowly, slowly.
Ahh, I think the pain is just about gone now.
Watch out, now! Watch out!
You'll cut yourself!
Pardon me, Major von Stroheim!
The old man found on the bank of the Rio Dada is awake.
We will question him!
Are you all right? What's your name?
Let me escort you home.
What was that for?!
How dare you call me a hag earlier?!
That punch was payback, jerk!
Did I...?
You did. Something about not fighting for a hag.
Seriously?
Well, that's odd! But you're so pretty.
Yowch!
You can't even remember your own words?!
You ogress...
She was too scared to feel the pain earlier.
But I'm worried about the Pillar Man Straizo mentioned.
Let's go to Mexico!
How are you feeling, Speedwagon?
We have a saying in Europe.
"A town where the old kill themselves is soon to fall."
I think you hold a secret as dangerous as that.
And it's about that man!
We obtained the pillar from the location we extracted from you!
God, why do this to me?! Why not let me die?!
Why did you let me live?!
You're mistaken, Speedwagon.
I am the one who made you live.
And the Wehrmacht made you talk!
Though you are old, we know that torture would not make you talk.
You went alone and penniless into Texas.
Near dead in the desert, you found oil fields
See?! German medicine is the world's greatest!
It can do anything!
A truth serum?!
What more do you want from me?!
Everything! Tell us everything!
Tell us about the past! About Straizo! About Joestar!
Tell us so we can awaken the Pillar Man!
N-No! You don't understand a thing!
He could destroy the world!
Prepare for the blood feeding experiment.
I expect perfection!
- Help us! - I don't want to die!
I have a proposal.
Choose one from among yourselves.
We need blood for an experiment.
The lot of you must choose who will be the one to die.
The rest of you will be released today.
I volunteer.
If I volunteer, you'll let everyone go, right?
Excellent, young man.
Courage like yours is to be commended.
We allow only the fit to live.
Execute everyone except the boy!
Let the experiment begin!
Next episode
Don't be too proud! He's dangerous!
I've brought you some tequila.
You. Who among you disturbed my slumber?
He's in the ventilation ducts!
Chapter 12: The Pillar Man
Hello, Kawajiri residence.
July 16th (Fri) 7:57 AM
Huh? No, it's not.
I see. Well done, Hayato.
You protected me from that nuisance, Rohan.
I'm telling you that you have the wrong number.
Goodbye.
They had the wrong number.
Now, then...
I guess I'll head to work so I can make
my precious family happy.
But first, do you mind if I give you a goodbye kiss?
Huh?
What are you doing?! My precious teapot...
Why would you do that?!
I never know what you're thinking!
You never even answer me! Why?!
Honestly...
Mom, he's not human.
it might not happen now, but he'll eventually kill me and my mom.
R-Rohan Kishibe...
There was someone other than Kira who had abilities.
I have to do something about Rohan Kishibe.
The only one who can save me and my mom and defeat Kira
is someone with abilities like Rohan Kishibe!
Th-There he is. It's Rohan.
If I meet Rohan, he'll be blown away and die...
And then I'll repeat the same morning again.
I have to tell Rohan about him without meeting him.
I'm going to change fate!
Flip
Wh-What is this?!
[Warning]
[Warning] You mustn't read any further.
It's Rohan's ability that he used one me the last morning!
Damn it.
I was hiding from Rohan this time!
Once fate has happened, it can't be changed...
Hayato.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
July 16th (Fri) 8:27 AM
Ugh, the forecast didn't say it was going to rain!
Bites the Dust, Part 2
but that is incorrect.
Whatever broke last morning will break again, no matter what.
It'll happen because it's meant to be.
That is what fate is.
you'll turn into a book, no matter what.
This is why Deadly Queen Bites the Dust is invincible.
It erases my identity and returns everything else to what it was.
That means I get to observe Rohan exploding before I head to work.
It rained.
At 8:27 AM, lightning struck above the Pepsi sign.
I can't let Rohan die!
I have to save Rohan!
Ah, Rohan Kishibe.
Watch carefully.
He has no idea why he's dying right now.
I wonder if he's thinking about how he won't be able to draw his manga anymore.
R-Rohan...
N-No!
But for now, I won't undo it.
A few of his friends should also be showing up, after all.
You're going to automatically defeat them for me, as well.
Just like a landmine.
so you should relax and enjoy your fun life as a young boy.
Well, I have to head to the station.
Make sure you study hard.
It's all my fault. It's because he met me...
Rohan Kishibe was killed because he met me!
Can't I do anything to defeat him?
Um... Can I ask you something?
Do you know what time it is?
My watch doesn't seem to be working right.
Hello? Are you listening?
It's 8:33...
Huh? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Where was it?
Do you know who I am?
No...
Huh... I guess I was imagining it.
Sorry for saying something weird.
8:33... Thanks!
Jotaro! It really is past 8:30.
Strange, though... I wonder where Rohan-sensei went.
Th-They're Rohan Kishibe's friends!
He left the car door wide open and the key in the ignition.
They probably have the same abilities...
Th-They also came to ask me about Yoshikage Kira.
That's not like Rohan-sensei...
Crap! If they find out that I'm Hayato Kawajiri
That's Rohan-sensei's earring.
and ask me about my dad...
Sorry about that.
Huh? I've seen you before... Where was it?
Ah, Josuke and Okuyasu.
Yo.
Yo, Koichi. Good morning, Jotaro.
What, so Rohan's the only one who's not here yet?
A-And two more...
When he said his friends were going to show up...
We won't know where Hayato Kawajiri's house is if he's not here.
He must have been talking about them!
I just remembered I accidentally grabbed onto this.
Here you go. Your hat.
Th-Thanks...
That angle...
It's that angle. I'm sure I've seen him before...
Where was it? I know I've seen him...
Koichi. Look at the name on his backpack.
Huh?
Hayato Kawajiri
Hayato Kawajiri?!
What?!
I-I've been found out!
Wake up
The weather report begins
Kira leaves the house
Hayato meets Rohan
Lightning strikes the Pepsi sign
Rohan Kishibe dies from explosion
July 16th (Fri) 8:34 AM
Hayato Kawajiri...
What are you doing here?
Is it a coincidence?
D-Does this have to do with Rohan-sensei not being here?
If these four start asking me about my dad...
They're all going to be blown away!
N-No! Don't ask me any questions...
If you guys die, too, who's going to defeat him?
Even if I have to deceive them...
I can't let these people die, no matter what!
I want to ask you about this photo...
I want to know why you were recording a video in this photo.
Why were you recording your da—
M-My nose is bleeding!
I need to go to the clinic! My nose is gushing blood!
Hold it.
Your nose is bleeding? Let me see.
Here. What happened?
I have to go. Excuse me.
You don't need to go to a clinic.
Your nose isn't bleeding.
Huh?
Huh?!
My name is Josuke Higashikata.
He's a relative of mine, Jotaro Kujo.
The one with the scary face over there is Okuyasu Nijimura.
And the friendly-looking guy there is Koichi Hirose.
You go to Budogaoka Elementary, don't you?
We just have some questions...
about this picture.
If it's nothing, then that's fine.
W-Well, it is something! Don't ask me any questions!
You can't ask me any questions!
Is the person in this picture
your da—
No! Don't say any more!
I-It's no use...
Now they're going to ask even more questions.
What do you mean by "Don't say anymore"?
One after another...
What are we not supposed to say?
I can't stop it anymore!
Are you talking about your dad?
They're going to explode!
They're all going to explode!
You suddenly shouted, "No!"
"Don't say any more"?
But we didn't ask you anything yet.
Could it be...
that even asking you a question is a bad idea?
They're going to explode... Explode... Explode...
I know...
I-If I die, no one else will have to die!
Since I'm the bomb, I just need to die!
If I die, I'm sure these people will be able to defeat him and save my mom!
Come on, ask him about Kosaku Kawajiri already.
Wait, Josuke. Something's wrong.
What are you crouching down for?
I-It won't go through...
For some reason, the box cutter won't go into my throat!
That's...
That Stand...
I'd never forget it after seeing it once!
Deadly Queen!
its Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.
It's already too late to attack.
It doesn't matter how many of you there are, because all at once...
You tried to find out my identity!
What, you're already awake?
I'm glad you replied for once when I called you, but there's no need to yell.
Breakfast is ready, so come on.
I couldn't stop it... Those four got attacked, too.
in an hour, fate is going to eliminate those four, too...
I can't even kill myself.
so Bites the Dust must be automatically protecting me.
He's too strong...
Yoshikage Kira is too much of a monster.
or those four are going to die for sure.
Either he has to die, or he has to undo Bites the Dust...
I always thought there was no way I could ever kill someone.
There was no way an 11-year-old boy like me could kill a monster like that.
But there is one way!
A way for an 11-year-old like me to kill him...
And it's sleeping quietly in the dark attic like a gun resting in an armory.
For the first time in my life, I was praying to God from the bottom of my heart.
"Lord, please let me kill this man somehow."
I was right.
and then attacks by shooting air bullets.
And even with just this little bit of light in the room, it's so destructive.
This behavior...
I'll utilize this behavior
and attack him with an air bullet at point blank range.
Point blank range...
But when and how am I supposed to do that?
I can't do it in or near the house.
Mom's here.
That's it... My hat!
That'll be point blank range!
My chance will be when he comes into range behind me.
That's when I have to do it!
What? No way! We're on the air already?
Er, um... It's now 7:55...
Dad was saying that he wanted another cup of coffee.
Hello?
No, you've got the wrong number.
This isn't the Sakurai residence.
Here you go, darling. Thanks for waiting.
Right...
It's a lovely morning.
I guess it wouldn't hurt to have another cup before I go to work.
Fate doesn't change with Bites the Dust, right?
Something that's been destroyed once will be destroyed, no matter how much I fight it.
You said that, didn't you?
My precious tea set!
Serves you right!
All right, Mom, I'm heading to school!
I'll be there for you. I'll protect you forever, Mom!
I can't believe it.
I really never have any idea what he's thinking... But...
Maybe he's not so bad after all.
Oh, it's fine. I'll clean that up.
There's nothing we can do now that it's broken.
More importantly, did you get burnt?
No... I'm fine.
He's not here yet...
H-He's not here... He's not here yet.
S-Something's wrong. He should have already been here by now...
Why isn't he here?
Ugh, the forecast didn't say it was going to rain!
I-It's starting to rain!
Did fate change because I left the house before him?
No, that can't be!
he should definitely come up from behind me.
L-Lightning struck the Pepsi sign!
Calm down. Calm down! There are still two minutes left!
There's more than two minutes before Rohan Kishibe is automatically blown away.
I need to believe in fate—
H-He's already by that tree... He's already right there!
What a lovely morning. But Hayato was acting strangely...
What was that?
It's just a hunch, but something was strange...
It appears that we've repeated this morning
three... no, four times now.
I-Is he just that intuitive?
But there's no more time!
I'll just have to attack him from here.
No... He's too close if he knows that.
But I have to completely defeat him in one shot.
If I miss, Rohan will explode, and then he'll undo Bites the Dust
after the other four are eliminated.
If that happens, he's going to win!
There's no time! Damn it...
I can attack!
What?! H-He's hidden himself even more!
The look in Hayato's eyes when he left the house...
He looked determined about something.
It's the same look that the loathsome Koichi Hirose and shitbag Josuke have.
My hunch is telling me to carefully observe him...
Though there really isn't much that Hayato can do...
It's too late!
That brat is shaking.
Those eyes look like a despaired mouse drowning in a cesspool.
I guess I was just imagining his determination.
Those are definitely the eyes of a loser.
He moved!
I came to bring the hat you forgot, Hayato.
If there is a God, I thank you!
I thank the fate that got this murderer to move from behind that tree!
I feel a fighting spirit burning within me!
Take this, Yoshikage Kira!
What?!
Y-Yes!
I hit him dead-on! I... I did it!
Hayato Kawajiri's not coming...
I guess he must've taken a different route to school.
This is the end, you murderer!
Wh-Wh-What?!
Lately...
Impossible!
With my nails growing so quickly...
I got to thinking about how unlucky I've been lately.
But inside my pocket...
It seems like, since last night, luck is coming around to my side.
Remember when Mom's precious tea cup broke this morning?
so I removed my watch and put it in my chest pocket.
What unbelievable luck!
If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...
How... How is that possible? I...
I... I failed!
Episode 37 Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 1
Episode 37 Shining breakable, Part 1
What unbelievable luck!
If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...
How... How is that possible? I...
You brat...
To think that you knew about Stray Cat, as well!
I guess it's futile.
So long as I don't undo Bites the Dust, it'll keep automatically protecting you.
I... I failed!
I-It's almost time!
The fact that you tried to kill me using Stray Cat's air bullets...
Hayato, you wouldn't have come up with that idea
And the fact that you've returned for the fourth time...
It means that Bites the Dust's fate
but another one of his friends, as well.
That means you must have told people other than Rohan about me.
No... Perhaps you were just asked about me.
Hm? Was there a shrimp named Koichi?
What about Jotaro Kujo?
E-Everything's over...
Letting you return to this morning again is dangerous.
Because I'll be attacked again.
Once the others die, I'll undo Bites the Dust for a short while.
Bites the Dust is invincible!
Luck is on the side of Yoshikage Kira!
That name... The name you said just now...
Oh, did I just say my real name?
Yes, my name is Yoshikage Kira.
I don't care if you tell that to anyone.
By the way, what time is it?
I...
I didn't tell anyone.
I never said a single word to anyone about you in the first place.
I only made a phone call.
so I found his number and woke him up.
I made a call from the house this morning. That's all!
You're the one who said it.
I was just waiting.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 1
Hey, Josuke.
We're gonna be on time to meet up with everyone.
Hold it, Okuyasu!
but this guy just said a name that I can't believe I heard.
I-I-Impossible!
You said "Yoshikage Kira" just now, didn't you?
Huh? What?!
H-How could such a coincidence...
It's no coincidence!
It's not fate, either! This was a gamble!
I made a gamble!
And he came!
I know I heard you say it!
It can't be...
You bastard!
H-He's Yoshikage Kira?
Th-That's impossible... You brat!
H-How could this be?
Return, Deadly Queen!
Cold... The rain is going down my back.
Honestly, does no one show up on time?
Oh?
That's Koichi and Jotaro.
Yes! I made it in time! I won against fate!
I don't need any intense joy.
But I didn't want any deep despair, either....
You've shown yourself!
I guess this picture that Rohan took was an instant jackpot.
Looks like it wasn't coincidence that we ran into him, Okuyasu.
we may have gotten here just in the nick of time.
Just so you know, I wasn't running away from you.
If I wanted to kill you all, I could have done so at any time.
The reason I didn't was just because I don't like fighting.
Strife is the exact opposite
but then you accumulate stress for your next battle.
It's a foolish thing to do.
Fighting with others is a sad and endless process.
We were coming after you because you killed Shigechi, you dumbass!
A pig bastard like you whose hobby is to kill people
Be careful, Josuke!
That's the only reason I didn't dispose of you all.
You're the only three destroying my peace right now.
I have no choice but to fight the ones who find out my identity.
Hey, get behind us, Hayato Kawajiri.
and it has the ability to fix anything that's been destroyed.
I won't need to use that ability against you!
Josuke!
Dora.
He's strong...
Yes! I can't see it, b-but that's amazing!
Kira just spit blood and went flying!
You're moving way too slow, Deadly Queen!
I guess yearning for a peaceful life has left you lacking in motivation.
Looks like your Stand isn't cut out for one-on-one battles.
Josuke, don't let your guard down just because he's slow!
Bring it!
Scraping away space to teleport, eh?
I attacked Josuke, but now the direction of my attack has turned...
Toward you.
I-Inside my backpack...
What?!
Though I guess it worked out.
I-I wasn't touched... I-I wasn't even touched...
The air... The air breathed fire!
Okuyasu!
Th-The air... breathed fire?
The reason I kept that thing around was for this.
I can use Stray Cat's ability to control the air for Deadly Queen's explosions.
Hayato, You brought it for me!
Invisible air and an unstoppable explosion!
Could any two things in this world be more compatible than that?
He was keeping it just for this purpose...
And I'm the one who brought it here!
I said that it appears luck is on my side, didn't I?
In Japanese, "fate" is written with characters meaning "luck that brings life."
How fitting.
The
The Ha
The Han
The Hand
Oku
Okuyasu
Okuyasu Niji
Okuyasu Nijimura
Is something wrong, Jotaro?
No, it's nothing.
I'm sure he overslept.
I'm going to head to Hayato Kawajiri's school without them.
I'll fix you right now, Okuyasu!
That's not going to happen.
Because I'm going to blow you away first.
It launched air like a bullet!
It's coming! You've got to run away!
You can't see it?
I-It's going to hit!
Fix?
The ability to fix things...
To think it's so fast that you were able to create a wall from the broken slate.
I-It's shooting again!
I-It's coming!
Presumptions are more terrifying than anything else.
Especially when you're under the impression that
I-It's starting to come through!
Even though it came in contact with it, it didn't explode!
Deadly Queen's explosions aren't limited only to things it touches.
That would be a presumption.
It can explode at any given distance.
it can go right through and explode freely!
You cannot run anymore.
Die!
It's no use! There's no way to dodge it!
I can't run?
And I haven't from the beginning.
Then I wouldn't be able to fix Okuyasu!
He's heading toward it?!
I-It went through!
You can make it explode at any distance?
Looks like there's an exception to that.
you're not going to be safe, are you?!
All right, Okuyasu. Now I can fix you.
Don't touch him!
I think... he might have just used Okuyasu's body and...
Damn that Hayato...
Impossible...
I didn't see Deadly Queen touch Okuyasu.
How can you tell, Hayato Kawajiri?!
I can tell!
I can tell by his expressions!
There's no doubt!
Yoshikage Kira!
I'm not sure...
It all happened so fast.
D-Don't, Yoshikage Kira!
Hurry up and shoot the next air bullet!
There's really no need to rush into attacking you right now.
Josuke Higashikata, I lose nothing by deciding whether to attack or not
There's a chance that Okuyasu wasn't turned into a bomb.
You might be able to fix him with Shining Diamond.
And that's for you to touch him and fix him.
you might die from the explosion, but Okuyasu won't.
D-Don't touch him!
I'll wait until you make your decision.
I have proof that you shouldn't touch him!
I'm sure he can't control more than one bomb at a time!
He changed Okuyasu into a bomb, so he can't shoot now!
What are you trying to say?
I'm telling you that there's a way to save Okuyasu-san!
Deadly Queen, switch on the bomb.
I just need to touch him!
What?!
H-Hayato, you...
All right! Shining Diamond!
You're insane, Hayato Kawajiri... You've got some guts.
Are you really a grade-schooler, kid?
If I wasn't expecting you to use your ability to f-fix things, I couldn't do it.
Besides, you can't die.
If you die, he can easily kill me, and then he'll be free.
He'll eventually kill my mom, too...
No, you'll die.
To think that your ability to fix things
I've just been reminded that it's the most troublesome ability to have against me.
Deadly Queen!
Josuke, he's firing!
I'll detonate it upon impact so you can't put your guard up.
I shot a small one so it'd be hard to see.
I wonder if you can dodge it while
Hurry up and run, Josuke!
If the explosion so much as grazes you next time, it'll be fatal!
Okuyasu! I fixed your wounds.
Hurry and move! He's going to get you!
Eight meters until impact.
Come on, you can wake up now!
Josuke!
Just seven more meters.
Just open your eyes, Okuyasu! Hey!
Hey, Okuyasu! Hurry up and open your damn eyes!
Hey! Let's work together like we always do and kick his ass!
Josuke...
and then detonate it from there.
Four meters until impact.
L-Let go! If you don't run, you'll be hit head-on!
Okuyasu is... Okuyasu is already...
Shut up!
Two more meters until impact.
The explosion will cover approximately a three-meter radius.
I see it! It's about two meters in front of you!
Hurry up and run away!
He's not dead!
Okuyasu is fixed!
I'll get it one meter closer and then push the button.
Josuke!
Splash
Th-The air bullet was split by a knife of blood!
Did the blood flowing through Josuke
That's it! Just like when I stabbed it with
He used the blood from his wound like a water pressure cutter
to cut through it...
But I wonder about the air bullet.
It didn't shrink! It's heading toward you!
An air bullet that's become a bomb is
That's why it won't shrivel!
It'll detonate as soon as you touch it.
All right, impact.
Huh? H-His body...
is floating?
Detonate!
No, it's not floating...
but if it's debris from the road
I can fix that!
Th-The piece of the road that was in his wound pulled his body!
I don't have a choice.
P-Please leave Okuyasu behind.
If you're holding Okuyasu, you'll be killed!
He'll catch up and he'll get you!
Would you just shut up, Hayato?
Okuyasu and I get along great. He's my friend!
That's not what I'm talking about!
Stop!
Don't. Don't you dare say any more.
Think about defeating him!
I don't like it...
The most terrifying thing getting in the way of my peace of mind isn't Jotaro.
It's him!
Josuke Higashikata!

Memo
Good morning.
Yes. I have to discipline my unreasonable son.
Yes, sir. I realize this would sound highly trivial to anyone else. Yes.
I am terribly sorry.
Yes, as soon as I'm done.
Yes.
Curse that Kosaku Kawajiri being so apologetic.
The reason Josuke went into that house
is because he knew he'd have the upper hand in a close-quarters battle.
I will admit that's true.
It's best that I avoid close-quarters combat with Shining Diamond.
I can shoot an air bullet from here, but...
Hey, you.
What do you think you're doing on this property?
What? Are you saying you're not on this property?
Don't get nitpicky with me, Mr. Goody Two-shoes.
Is this your house?
Hey, I'm the one asking the questions here.
I was thinking about sleeping past noon
You make me suspicious.
Rio, from next door, said her underwear gets stolen all the time.
And since everyone's gone around this time...
I'm envious...
Huh?
Of all the free time you seem to have.
Hey, are you running away?
Damn him... Going after Rio like that.
Pisses me off!
He was an underwear thief after all!
These panties...
Th-They're Rio's...
P-P-Pan...
Woohoo! I'm so lucky!

I-It's no use! The phone line's been cut!
Okuyasu is dead...
I'm going to beat the crap out of
I'm going to end this within a few minutes.
Hayato, stay along the wall there so that Kira can't see you.
Where is he...
going to enter from... is the question.
Huh?!
Wh-What?
J-Josuke!
It's an air bullet!
It's about the same size as earlier...
There's no way he can tell where you are from outside!
Great...
I know, Josuke Higashikata...
Three meters until impact...
I... I can tell...
You'll be able to dodge it!
What?
I-It's going after Josuke?
Yoshikage Kira knows where I am.
Where is he? How is he seeing me?
There were no windows in that room!
The curtains are all drawn, too!
There's no way he can see you from outside!
It's automatic! It must be automatically chasing you!
No, that's not right.
The version of Deadly Queen that's
But... It's not going after the lit cigarette there.
and Yoshikage Kira plans to do the final detonation himself to finish me off.
It's a mystery, but he knows exactly where I am!
It's getting faster!
Find Kira for me!
I-I found him!
H-He's right outside the gate.
Two meters until impact...
He's outside?
I can't figure out how he's able to pinpoint your location from there, Josuke.
Hurry and run!
That bastard! I don't know how he's watching me...
One more meter!
But I didn't want you chasing me in the first place!
Shining Diamond!
All right, it's going to impact on Josuke!
Yes! It was a direct hit!
Deadly Queen!
My, my, that was close.
But I was on my guard.
Your willpower to try to get one final blow in...
That's why I won't go near you, Josuke Higashikata.
J-Josuke!
H-He's alive...
Hmph. It was a direct hit, but he wasn't blown away.
There's a slight discrepancy when I detonate by hand...
But the damage is absolute.
I can finish him off with the next shot!
W-We... We have to get away from here!
Y-You're pulling me the wrong way...
This is the opposite direction...
Not that way... It's the opposite direction!
I'm going to kill him!
We need to go in the direction of Yoshikage Kira...
My Shining Diamond
can't fix my own wounds...
But once my blood has left my body and hardened, it's just another object.
It's no longer part of me.
Therefore, I can gather it and stick it onto other things.
So I stuck some inside a shard of glass.
The rain stopped, and the blood stain on his jacket earlier...
should have hardened by now!
That's my automatic tracking bomb.

The shard of glass that I was able to guard against...
It must be this blood stain...
This stain must have led that glass shard right to me!
I-It was a direct hit!
It's embedded right into Kira's back!
That's...
Josuke Higashikata's Shining Diamond is a Stand whose actions I can't foresee...
But the damage Josuke sustained is greater than mine.
Just one more shot!
I-It's here! Th-This one's big enough to see!
That must mean...
that this is his final shot.
This will be mine, too!
I-I don't think the same attack will work twice on Kira!
He'll dodge it!
We'll just have to see about that...
but the lighter from earlier is in my pocket.
Could you get it for me?
It's a bit hard for me to get it myself with
The smoke is useless now!
You can see the air bullet!
The air bullet isn't what I want to use the lighter to see this time.
I'm going to look at something else... So...
Let's find out why he can see where I am.
Don't move, Hayato.
J-Josuke? Wh-What are you...
Stay still, Hayato.
He might not be watching...
He might be listening.
Kira had a cell phone.
So then, who was he talking to?
Was it his boss from the office? No, that's not right.
There's only one person that Kira would be calling right now...
I'd completely forgotten about you, old man in the picture...
The one who's trying to protect Yoshikage Kira!
I have no idea when he got inside my pocket, but...
So this was the answer!
Th-The air bullet passed through the window!
Get back!
It impacted!
Josuke... is running away three meters ahead.
Sh-Shit!
I-It passed him!
And he's now moving diagonally right, then up... Three meters.
He hasn't figured out that it's Josuke because he's using a raspy voice!
And now, he's running away one meter to the left...
What?! How can you do that, you bastard?!
Right there. Detonate!
Yoshikage!
I did it! Josuke's been blown away, hasn't he?
Yeah, he was gloriously blown away.
All the way to Hell, with my directions.
so it's more like he finally made it over.
Josuke...
J-Josuke!
Th-This must be some kind of mistake...
Something this horrible...
should not be happening in my life...
But what I mustn't forget at times like these
that opportunities present themselves.
I've learned that in the past.
opportunities will make themselves available!
I, Yoshikage Kira, have always done this.
There is no trouble that I was
unable to overcome...
Ever!
You're within my range...
Yoshikage Kira!
H-He's near him!
H-He finally got near him!
This is a close-quarters match, and it'll be over in an instant.
b-but if Kira touches him, he'll be turned into a bomb!
A-And the wounds in Josuke's leg and torso from that blast...
Josuke, you shouldn't even be able to stand right now.
Josuke Higashikata!
Bring out... your Deadly Queen...
Deadly Queen!
H-He's strong...
I'm going to be defeated...
I, Yoshikage Kira, am going to be defeated!
N-No... How could...
We were so close! Josuke is stronger than him!
Is fate really on the side of that murderer?
M-My fists didn't hit him...
These air bullets acted like cushions!
B-But it wasn't my intention to have it guard me...
Stray Cat!
so it instinctively blocked the attack!
This is my chance! This is that chance!
A opportunity has presented itself at the worst of times, after all!
Deadly Queen!
Change that air bullet into a bomb!
I've won!
I've changed it into a contact bomb!
you won't have the strength to dodge this!
Yoshikage Kira!
It's a contact bomb?!
Josuke! It doesn't matter if it's glass or wood!
I've won! This always happens when life deals its worst to me!
Luck is on the side of Yoshikage Kira!
Wh-What?!
Th-The air bullet went off its course!
Y-You're...
You're...
You're...
O-Okuyasu!
You know, I always wonder
where all the stuff I scrape away with The Hand goes.
There.
What?!
I-I can't believe it... I-It's Okuyasu.
But his heart and breathing had completely stopped...
I had a weird dream...
While I was walking amid the darkness in that dream, I saw a light.
And I saw my dead brother...
My big brother, Keicho.
so I said that I was going to follow him.
I mean, my Bro was always reliable.
He never made any bad decisions, so I'd have nothing to worry about.
But then he said I should decide for myself.
He said, "Okuyasu, you're the one who has to decide where you're going to go."
and answered that I was going back to Morioh, and then I woke up.
It was a really sad dream.
Okuyasu...
Y-You've got some nerve, dreaming at a time like this!
you seem pretty okay.
Shut up!
If you were alive, you should have woken up sooner, damn it!
I-Impossible... Fate should have been on my side...
I should have been given my opportunity!
Stray Cat! Shoot another shot!
Wh-What?!
Wh-Wh-Whoa... Whoa, there.
Y-Yes! Now Kira won't be able to use his air bullet bombs!
Th-Th-There's...
There has never been any trouble that I, Yoshikage Kira, was unable to overcome!
Look, Jotaro!
That loud sound must've come from that house.
I wonder what happened. Was it a gas explosion?
L-Look! That man is injured!
Josuke and Okuyasu are there, too!
That kid is Hayato Kawajiri from the picture.
And that man is Kosaku Kawajiri.
It looks like everything's falling into place.
Any fate that would side with you...
Any opportunity that would come your way...
is nothing compared to the heart of justice that's here right now!
It's definitely here! It's right here for sure!
Compared to that heart, you're nothing!
Episode 39 Goodbye, Morioh – The Heart of Gold

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
Th-This is a dream...
This... is a dream.
The idea that I'm being cornered like this...
You don't have...
...anywhere left to run.
You're finished.
J-Josuke's badly hurt...
The battle had already begun while we were waiting.
Which means...
That's Yoshikage Kira.
Someone's hurt over there!
Get back! There's a chance of an explosion from a gas leak!
Bring the ambulance over here!
Bring the stretcher!
It's dangerous, so please get back!
Are you all right?
Just get back!
Can you hear me? An ambulance is on its way.
You're going to be all right.
Don't let that lady near Kira!
We'll get you treated at the hospital right away.
Please, hang in there.
It'll be okay. Hang in there.
O-Oh, no!
That lady's been turned into a bomb!
Can you see how many fingers I'm holding up?
Jotaro, we need your Star Platinum.
I know.
But it's no use unless I can get closer.
I have to get at least five meters closer.
You turned someone into a bomb and took them hostage?
Just try it! I'll fix her right up in a heartbeat!
No! It's not as simple as taking a hostage!
He's got a hidden ability!
It's an ability called Bites the Dust, and it can blow away time!
Goodbye, Morioh – The Heart of Gold
and occurs coincidentally whenever Kira is in trouble.
Which means, when he's in despair like this, this ability activates
What the hell?
The knuckles and skin on your hand are so soft...
You have such cute, white fingers...
Will you rub my cheek?
Huh?
Rubbing my cheek calms me down so much...
When I was a child...
You've heard of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, right?
When I saw that painting in an art book...
I don't know how to put it...
Um, this is a bit dirty, but...
Everything About Leonardo da Vinci's World
I got an erection.
I just cut out the part with her hands
I want to cut off yours, too.
What are you doing?!
My name is Yoshikage Kira!
I've killed 48 women with beautiful hands up to now.
You're the only one!
O-Oh, no! Bites the Dust is about to start!
Jotaro!
Are you coming for me, Jotaro?
Bites the Dust was created because I didn't want to run into you!
Come closer! Just try and stop time!
How long will you be able to stop it?
Pushing me to the limit again will make Bites the Dust appear!
Jotaro, stop time!
Don't let him push Killer Queen's switch!
Wh-What?
No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...
Now!
I-I did it! It activated!
I was able to return!
I was able to have Bites the Dust take effect again!
I beat them!
Now I can be free!
What was that just now?
The birds came from behind me and...
Come to think of it, this isn't the way I usually take to work...
What time is it right now?
That's right. I had put my watch in my chest pocket.
This is...
Why is it broken?!
The watch that Hayato broke with Stray Cat should have returned to normal, too!
Haven't you realized it?
So the Kosaku Kawajiri that Rohan took a picture of was Yoshikage Kira...
And it's finally over, isn't it?
They finally cornered you, Yoshikage Kira.
Who are you?
You don't remember me?
Well, I guess that's no surprise.
Something very traumatic must have happened.
Something so traumatic that you don't even realize what happened to you.
Are you a new Stand user?!
I'll make you realize that you're already dead!
What?
This isn't any Stand ability!
This is proof that all that's here is the completely black soul of a dead killer!
Well? Do you remember how you died now?
Even if I stop time right now, I'm too far away from him.
Don't let him push the switch!
No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...
Now!
Act Three! 3 Freeze! He's now within five meters!
S-h-i-t!
You rotten pieces of shit!
Star Platinum! The World!
Koichi, you truly are a reliable guy.
I'm truly thankful that I came to this town and met you.
And...
Good grief.
Time has begun to move again.
Crush
H-He did it!
He made it in time!
I'll push it... I'm gonna push it...
Bites the Dust will go into effect again...
H-How? He just suddenly went flying back!
I'm gonna push it... I-I'm gonna push it...
I'm gonna push the switch right now...
I know he's our enemy, but he really is something.
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Morioh Fire Department
Someone's on the ground back here!
What?!
O-Oh, no! A guy's been run over by an ambulance!
I didn't realize he was there!
Drive back forward! Forward!
You there! Get outside of the tape!
Get back! Please hurry and get back!
Are you one of the injured, too?
It's no use. He's dead. He died instantly.
He's dead?
It was like he dove under there himself.
This is my responsibility.
I'm not trying to make excuses, but I didn't have a chance to restrain him.
This is unbelievable.
His head was caught between the tire and the road...
The skin on his face has been ripped off.
Pardon me.
Do you happen to know the identity of the deceased?
He said that his name was Yoshikage Kira.
Kira...
There's a family by the name of Kira in Kotodai that goes back generations.
I heard its only current member lives alone, so he might not have any family...
An accident... His demise was due to an accidental death.
But this is how it should be.
There would be no way to punish him in court.
This was the best outcome.
I... didn't actually get along with my dad that well...
But my dad was murdered by him.
I wanted him punished.
I wanted someone to punish him.
It looks like you remember, Yoshikage Kira...
The exact way you died.
It looks like you remember now!
Just what are you?! Who the hell are you?!
That's why, when I died, it was in all the papers.
Do you remember this wound on my back?
so perhaps I wasn't as memorable?!
It's you...
I believe your name was Reimi Sugimoto...
What the hell have you been doing here for fifteen years?!
Wait...
Why would you go to the trouble of showing me
This wouldn't be the place where you're not supposed to turn around, is it?
and if you were to find yourself there, you must not turn around.
If you were to turn around, an uncontrollable power
You weren't showing me
You weren't trying to trick me, were you?
Let's have you turn around.
Come on! Turn around!
Did you really think
that I didn't expect you to try to do this to me?
We've been waiting fifteen years for you to come here...
"We"?
Arnold!
What?!
Now, let's have you punished, Yoshikage Kira.
What? What are these things?!
Deadly Queen!
Make these things explode!
I-I...
Wh-Where are they going to take me?
Who knows?
But...
I'm sure it's somewhere you won't be able to rest in peace.
We can finally go...
Help Wanted
Reimi! Are you really leaving?
It wouldn't hurt if you stayed a little longer, would it?
It feels like this town's losing its guardian angel...
It makes me uneasy, knowing that you're leaving.
Thanks... But there's nothing left for us to do in this town.
The time has come for us to leave this town.
Or what? Are you going to cry when I leave
Don't be stupid.
Kisara Drugs
Why would I miss you?
I said this before, but I still believe that ghosts should give up
Oh, fine! Since this is the last time, I'll be honest!
I will miss you!
Of course I don't want you to go!
Hey.
Josuke! Everyone!
So it's finally over, Reimi.
Yukako! Hazamada, and everyone else!
We came to see you off.
Everyone...
I know it's strange to say this to a dead person, but take care.
I'm going to miss you, too.
You're a wonderful young lady.
Reimi! Thank you for everything!
Because of you, this town was saved!
Thanks, Koichi.
I'm sure that no one here will ever forget you.
Thank you, everyone.
Goodbye, everyone.
Goodbye, Reimi.
Goodbye...
He's awfully late tonight...
I wonder if he had to work overtime.
He could call, at least...
Oh, Hayato.
I'll eat when your father gets home.
Hayato?
I'll wait, too...
I'll eat with you
when Dad gets home, too...
You sure?
By the way, have you gotten a little taller lately?
Our town, Morioh, was deeply hurt.
The town was hurt by the monster named Yoshikage Kira
I'm sure that Hayato's mom
Shigechi's parents will forever be waiting for him to return.
The families of the daughters and sisters killed by Yoshikage Kira
The pain of their wounds will now only get deeper.
How can we try to ease this pain?
Will it be life-threatening for this town's future, or will it eventually disappear?
I have no idea.
Are you worried, Jotaro?
About leaving this town?
Yeah, a little.
there's one thing that I can say...
That the young people in this town have hearts of gold.
The same hearts of gold shining with justice
I saw that within Josuke and the others...
As long as they have that, they'll be fine.
We won't have to worry about this town any longer.
Hey, Old Man!
Can't you hear me, Old Man?
Now, then... I guess I should say goodbye to the son I'm so proud of.
The picture of my mom that I just gave you...
Yes. I put it in my wallet, just as you asked.
I'm leaving without seeing your mother, but I wish her nothing but happiness.
Ah... So you put it in your wallet...
This is the edge of that picture.
Shining Diamond!
I'll be taking this!
A dad should give his son an allowance, right?
Y-You little brat...
You gonna take back what you said about him having a heart of gold, old man?
Take care!
Jotaro Kujo got his doctorate from a thesis he wrote
Josuke, that jerk!
He ate the snack I was saving for myself again!
Ugh!
I'm gonna drink his juice.
Koichi!
Sorry!
Huh? You made us lunch? Thanks!
I can't wait to eat it.
So good!
Whew
Oh, here it comes! Yeah! That intensity!
You might be able to turn back to normal, Dad!
Well, whatever.
My skin is so soft!
My eyes feel so refreshed!
The food here was amazing!
Right? Even I look so much more beautiful that I don't know what
You're shining, Yu.
So shiny!
You think so?
I'm shiny, eh?
Grazie!
I look forward to your next visit.
I just saw Ko holding hands with a really pretty girl!
Huh? What does that mean? He hasn't told me anything!
Did you hear about Mr. Kira who went missing?
I did! You mean how he turned up as a faceless corpse, right?
That's so scary...
What are you gonna do about it?
Wha?
I'm telling you that juice sprayed out from the can
That's not my problem!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
All right. Warm-up exercises done.

It is.
And so, for most people, the summer of 1999 passed like any other summer.
Hey, did you hear?
Apparently, Rohan was caught shoplifting at Kame Yu.
What?!
That's insane if it's true.
Yeah, but I'm not really sure.
You aren't even sure?
Jeez... Well, let's go.

Hey, mister! This is the best deal you're going to find in town!
That's exactly what the other guy said.
Then as a bonus, I'll give you a tour of the city!
Seriously?
Hilarious!
Huh? What?
What's wrong?
My bag is gone!
What?
Here you go.
So, any changes lately?
Not at all, thanks to you.
I see.
Sorry to bother you.
This is what you want, right?
Yeah!
Oh, but this is all I have right now.
Then this is all I can sell you.

It's a famous tourist spot so beautiful that
Pardon us.
How do you get to Santa Chiara?
Oh, to get to Santa Chiara, go straight, and then, at the first light—
See? I told you!
I told you it was over there.
My bad...
Thanks so mu—
Whoa, there.
Are you all right?
Th-Thank you...
Um, I'm sorry about that.
Be more careful.
Let's go.
Hey.
You dropped this.
Thank you so much!
No problem.
Hey, wasn't that guy super cool?
I should've asked for a picture.
Did those just come out of my bag?
What? They probably just landed on it for a second.
Yeah, you're right.
You can't let your guard down in this city.
Pardon me.
Could I get a cone with a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of pistachio?
Make that two.
You got it.
Episodio 01 Golden Wind
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you
Move your car!
Honestly...
You only moved one car length away!
So, whaddya say? It's faster than lining up.
What do you think?
I'll get you into the city real cheap.
Really? How cheap?
L-Luca!
Didn't I tell you that you need to pay
You can't be serious!
I told you that you need to pay the protection fees you owe me
But...
Right?!
But I have a family...
P-Please stop!
You should think more about your friendship with me than your family...
Got it?
I'm not the only one ignoring you to keep doing business!
Well, who?
Who is it?
I-It's Giorno! Giorno Giovanna!
Giorno?
That kid's been making a fortune lately!
Giorno?
Well, I'll deal with him later.
Hey, you!
You can't run your business here without a license!
Go somewhere else!
Buon giorno!
I'm finally here!
That flight was so long!
The air sure is different here!
Now, then, time to get to work.
Haruno Shiobana... That's an unusual name.
First, I need to get to my hotel.
I want to dump my luggage so I can move around a bit more freely.
Let's see... Where's the taxi pick-up...
Whoa, that's amazing!
I know, right? That trick is amazing!
This shouldn't be possible!
How are you even doing that?
That's so gross!
How'd you stuff your whole ear into your head?
Man, that was entertaining!
Thanks.
Don't attract too much attention with your job here.
Looking for a taxi?
No, n-not really...
You sure?
I'm just finishing up my part-time job and about to head home, so I'll make it cheap.
How about 180,000 lire to get you into the city?
180,000? That's... about 10,000 yen.
That's way too expensive!
Wow, you speak the language perfectly.
Huh?
Did you used to live in Italy?
No, I just had Rohan-sensei make it so I could speak... Never mind that!
M-More importantly, you're saying you'll drive?
You look like you're only in middle school or high school.
And I saw you give the security guys something.
I'm pretty sure I saw some money. What's that about?
Come on, now. You don't need to worry about those things.
Okay, how about for 10,000 lire?
I won't even ask for a tip.
Huh? 10,000 would be about... 500 yen?!
No, it's okay.
Are you sure?
You'll really only charge 10,000?
Yup.
Since I'm not asking for a tip.
Put your luggage up front. You can sit in the back.
Just get me to my hotel in earnest.
Yes. I'll get you there in earnest.
Or should I say... I'll get your empty luggage there.
Huh? Wait... I didn't even get in yet...
Keep your mouth shut!
Don't tell me...
Hold it!
Ciao!
Reverb Act 3!
Too bad for you...
Didn't I tell you not to underestimate me?
You can run if you want.
Look at that! Giorno actually screwed up!
That's what he gets for trying to trick
It couldn't be...
Huh? It's gone! How?!
Is this some kind of egg?
I-Is it a Stand?! But that's impossible!
Would one show up the second I get to Italy?!
That's not a Stand! The way that frog felt...
It's actually alive!
But seriously, how'd my suitcase disappear?!
He didn't have any time to hide it!
This is horrible!
This is only a hunch, but...
Excuse me!
Could I ask you some questions about that taxi driver?
I think it's about time...
Are you Giorno Giovanna?
This is the first time we're meeting.
Leaky Eye Luca.
I heard that
Hey, why don't you have a seat right here?
Come on, sit down.
It's tiring having to look up at you to talk.
How old are you?
Fifteen.
Fifteen?! Wow, you're just a kid!
Say, Giorno, there are three "yous" to remember in friendship.
Three "yous," got that?
The first one is you don't lie.
The second one is you don't hold grudges.
And the third is you respect the other.
Sounds good, right? Those are the three "yous" of friendship.
Can I help you?
k
 the one talking right now!
I heard you've been working part-time around the airport...
I, Leaky Eye Luca, haven't received
How do you expect our friendship to last like that?
Let me take a peek at your wallet.
Luca.
I already paid my protection fees. I don't have any money.
To the security guards?!
What's this? A photo of a family member?
Where's my money?
Luca...
Don't make me say the same thing twice.
I told you, I already paid, so I don't have any.
Don't make me say it a third time.
You little shit!
What the hell is that creature?
It came back.
Smack it off!
This frog has nothing to do with this.
I gave you an order, and I told you to pay me a protection fee!
So you're going to disobey both of those?
You're going to tell me, Leaky Eye Luca, "no" to both of those things?!
You really shouldn't.
You're... You're...
I could never just smack it off.
Don't! It's harmless as long as you don't do anything!
You're finished!
Whack
I told you not to.
It's just trying to protect itself. It has its own life.
Any attack on it becomes an attack on oneself, and it's fatal.
And...
Making me say the same thing over and over again
is useless.
And I hate that because it's useless.
Totally useless.
A piece of this guy's skin?
so the Speedwagon Foundation can check its composition.
Its composition? Who is this guy?
His father, who died, was a bit special.
It can be thin. I just need you to get me a piece.
That's it.
I see...
I'll cover all your expenses for this trip.
What?! All of them?
Hmm...
I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but this guy sort of looks like you, Jotaro.
The address on this picture is somewhere around here...
How careless.
You don't need to worry about them.
No one around here is dumb enough to try and steal their briefcase.
Oh... I guess this is a nice neighborhood.
Hey, can I sit next to you?
Would you like to come in for a meal, sir?
No, I'm going to sit next to him!
N-No, it's okay!
Hey, Giorno! Have some tea with me!
What? Wait, I'll pay for you!
You guys are too loud.
No, me! Me!
I like being alone. Go away.
Fine...
See you tomorrow, Giorno!
Ciao!
Th-That's—
Hey! Whose money is that?! Are you using my money?!
You?! How'd you know I was here?
Give me back my passport! Where's my luggage?!
but they're gone. I sold them off, unfortunately.
So stop following me.
You're not getting away this time!
What's with this weight?
Wait... So that wasn't a malfunction earlier?
Don't tell me... he has the same kind of powers as me...
What did you just say?
It's heavy!
Golden Wind!
Life, spring forth!
Bring forth new life!
I think I just caught a glimpse of something.
Act 3!
That bastard disappeared.
That's impossible!
I'll say this one more time. Don't even think about coming after me.
I hate saying things twice when I shouldn't have to.
Because it's useless to say it twice.
I'll say this for your own good.
Knock him down, Act 3!
Th-The attack on the tree came back to me...
You're a good person.
There's no doubt about it. Giorno Giovanna...
He's a Stand user!
Giorno Giovanna
Golden Wind
Hello?
Jotaro, it's me, Koichi!
Oh, Koichi. Did you get to Italy?
I found him!
That was fast.
Where do I even begin?
And, yes, it's safe to say...
He's a Stand user!
He goes by the name Giorno Giovanna in Italy.
You mentioned before that
Stand users are drawn to other Stand users, right?
We seriously met by coincidence!
He's a student, but he acts like a delinquent.
And it appears his Stand's ability is
Sorry about all this.
Thank you.
Something about his dead father's genes.
Who's his father?
Are you and his father somehow related?
I'm the one
who killed his father.
His name is DIO Brando.
DIO?
You mean the one involved with the bow and arrow?
I found out this year that DIO may have had a child.
That's why I wanted to find out for sure
if Giorno Giovanna was really DIO's child, and if he's somehow inherited his body.
But doesn't DIO's body belong to the Joestar bloodline?
The fact that his hair turned blond may be a sign that
the DIO blood in him, his Stand power, recently awakened.
There might have been a trigger...
A powerful Stand user?
Don't go near him anymore.
It's dangerous to take this further.
Understand?
Just one last question...
Is he our enemy?
Or is he a friend?
What do you think?
You're the one who actually met him.
What was your impression of him?
I'm not sure.
But, um...
He seemed like a very eloquent person.
Did you drop this?
No.
I see.
Guess it's mine now.
Let's say you found a bag with one billion lire inside.
would you take it to the authorities?
No way. I'd totally take it.
Well, aren't you honest?
But what if I was a plainclothes police officer and saw you take it?
I'd give you half and have you look the other way... probably.
Wow, that's great!
And I'm sure that's actually what you'd do.
You're not kidding or bluffing.
I can tell! You're telling the truth.
You see... I can tell if people are telling the truth or not.
I'm almost certain.
You know how your skin gets shiny when you sweat?
That's how I can tell.
I think I'll have an even better idea if I taste your sweat.
Who are you?
Leaky Eye Luca was found on the ground near the airport after having
It's a rather serious injury. He won't be regaining consciousness.
I'm trying to find out who's responsible.
Giorno Giovanna, no one knows why Leaky Eye Luca was at the airport.
But the airport security guards
That's why I figured I'd come see you and ask you some questions.
Are you actually a police officer?
Of course not.
Luca's no ordinary crook. He's a gang member.
He knew how to get people to hate him.
But that's not what his boss is thinking about.
The boss feels like his name was
That's why he told me to find out who took him out and settle the score.
I'm asking you...
No. I don't know who you're talking about.
You're not sweating.
That does it for my questions.
What is that?
That's Luca's right eye.
He's unconscious anyway, so I just brought it.
This taste... is the taste of someone who's lying, Giorno Giovanna!
Well, well, well, well...
but the situation seems to have changed, Giorno Giovanna.
You told me a lie.
What are you looking at?
My name is Bruno Bucciarati.
Answer me.
Well? This is a pretty creepy ability, isn't it?
Th-That's...
Those are Luca's fingers.
To tell you the truth...
He said that there's no point in him living anymore.
I took his fingers for torturing.
It's happening again! What the hell?
Is he also like that Japanese tourist?
Other than being able to tell if people are lying or not, I can also do this...
I can put whatever I want in your mouth.
For example...
I can even put that fire extinguisher in your mouth.
Though I'm afraid you'd die if I did that...
Talk!
You know who's responsible.
Were you told not to tell anyone?
Let's have you tell me who did Luca in.
There's no doubt about it... He has a similar ability!
Giorno Giovanna!
This guy's bad news!
In that case...
I'll have to use Golden Wind and dodge his attacks!
Episodio 02 Bucciarati Is Coming
Episodio 02 Bucciarati Is Coming
Giorno Giovanna.
so it's unknown how Giorno's mother was able to give birth
but she was far from a model mother.
leaving young Giorno alone at home.
You sure you should leave your kid home alone?
Isn't he, like, two or something?
Oh, it's fine.
I'm not about to lose my freedom just because I had a kid.
Shiobana
Giorno would wake up in the middle of the night, and his mother wouldn't be there.
How terrifying and despairing that must be for a child of one or two.
There was no point in crying, so Giorno would just sit there, trembling.
When Giorno was four, his mother got married.
She married an Italian, and therefore, Giorno also became an Italian citizen.
Um...
What are you doing over here?
Come on, Haruno.
You mother's waiting for you.
But as you'd suspect, when Haruno's mother wasn't around...
You're always looking at me, trying to figure out what mood I'm in.
You annoying little brat!
But it was actually the opposite.
What's the matter?
Oh, the bread.
Here you go.
Jeez, you're such a gloomy kid.
The one who got him into the habit of trying to read others' moods
was this man himself.
This made Giorno
Whoa, what's wrong, Giorno?
Hey, you kids. Hurry up and get home.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Go back to Japan, you little freak.
He never fights back, does he?
He's so creepy.
and that it was only a matter of time until
But a certain incident would save Giorno from this fate.
Damn it, where did he go?
Find him! Don't let him get away!
He can't get far with those wounds!
You don't think he went into someone's house, do you?
Keep your eyes on the ground! There should be blood.
You go straight ahead. We'll go this way.
Hey, kid.
Have you seen an injured man around here?
He's tall and has black hair.
He went that way.
That way?
He won't be able to move fast with those wounds!
Let's find him!
He felt no fear.
He just felt that the man
Come on!
Coming!
Thankfully, the man was hidden behind the grass, which was suddenly taller.
but Giorno didn't know he had this ability yet, so he did it subconsciously.
Around two months later...
I'll never forget what you did for me.
Damn it!
Why does he care so much about Giorno?
Come sit over here, Giorno.
Come on, don't be shy.
The mean kids changed their tune.
I know it's not the best seat, but...
The man was a gangster.
Here you go, kid!
This is... too much.
I think there's been a mistake...
The scoop of chocolate is my treat!
Thanks...
Don't sweat it! That guy always takes really good care of me.
The man would always just quietly watch over him.
What was that?
A gunshot?
We shouldn't get involved.
Talk about bad luck...
U-Um...
What is it?
Hey, wait up!
Hold it!
You're the one who killed my dad, aren't you?!
You little shit! Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Your dad was scum.
He broke the rules of my turf by selling drugs.
He even sold them to women and children.
That's why I killed him.
How? Why?!
You're...
You're a piece of scum, too!
Giorno didn't think the man was scum in the least.
Bizarrely, the gangs that committed crimes and broke the law
were what straightened out Giorno's heart.
Giorno Giovanna found his reason to live.
he wanted to become a Gang-Star!
This taste... is the taste of someone who's lying!
My name is Bruno Bucciarati.
Answer me.
Your questioning has already turned into torture.
Does your head feel wobbly, as if it's about to fall off?
Though I'm pretty sure you have no idea what I've done to you.
My body has a zipper?!
Giorno Giovanna.
If I wanted to, I could roll your head around like a ball
I don't think I could withstand another one of his attacks.
He'll tear me apart!
but I've never used Golden Wind to attack another human.
When Golden Wind hits something, it can give it life.
Any object can change into any living thing.
But...
Even I don't know what'll happen if
it attacks another human being!
Answer me, Giorno Giovanna!
I don't have any other choice!
Useless!
Bagyah
What?!
Rumble
Y-You're...
a Stand user!
Rumble
So you could see my ability!
A what user?
So you're the one who attacked Luca!
Didn't Golden Wind hit him head-on?
Then he should at least have a broken bone or two.
You bastard...
Wh-What?
What did you do to me, you bastard?!
What the? I was just trying to stand...
I can feel more and more power rising in me...
It's as though my body's been filled with the gasoline of life.
What?
Whoosh
Could it be that I ended up like this because of your ability?
Whoosh
Whoosh
You're a fool if you have a Stand that grants your enemies power!
Take this, Giorno Giovanna!
What? I can see myself...
What am I doing back there?
The handle's not bent!
Did I misunderstand what's going on?
I just thought I was moving with incredible power...
Crap! I have to dodge!
I-It hurts!
It's not that Giorno's slow... It's that my consciousness went berserk!
Useless!
they go berserk... or at least, just their senses do.
m
but I'll definitely be taking advantage of it.
Bruno Bucciarati
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
I'm gonna call the police!
I'm sorry for all the ruckus.
Please rest assured that we'll make sure not to involve any civilians.
So this is Giorno Giovanna's Stand?
No... It doesn't seem like he even knows what a Stand is.
But this ability...
It appears as though both of our abilities only reach a few meters.
And here I thought you were just some brat
Giorno Giovanna!
My boss wants to know why you attacked him!
You wouldn't believe me if I told you it was an accident, would you?
So I'm going to be disposed of, right?
And you came here fully prepared, right?
you're always prepared for the possibility that
He's going to kill me... He's serious!
This brat is actually going to try to kill me!
He's intense enough
Kabaam
Zipper Man!
So that's his Stand?
Kashink
Now I know for sure that my Zipper Man is more powerful.
I wasn't told that I need to bring the suspect back alive.
I wouldn't mind taking care of you here.
so I'm leaving.
but I'll take care of you eventually.
He can even pass through a solid wall by putting a zipper on it?!
This isn't good!
If I lose him now, it won't matter that I have Golden Wind!
there's absolutely no guarantee I'll survive!
I'm going to lose!
I can't let him get away!
If he tells his friends about me, this will end up out of my control!
I have to stop him right here, right now!
For the sake of my future!
O-Ow!
Be more careful, damn it!
He disappeared!
Where could he have gone in that instant?
Don't tell me he can even enter people with his zipper!
What are you going to do about this? I'm covered in garbage!
But that's the only thing I can think of!
That must be how he got that eyeball and those fingers inside me!
Bucciarati went into one of these guys to hide, like wearing a costume...
And that's how he's planning to head back into the city.
Better get my broom...
They're all heading in different directions.
I don't see a zipper.
Which one is it?
Which one is he hiding in?
What the hell's your problem, you stupid fly?!
Jump
A tooth?
I gave life to the tooth that broke out of your mouth
and had it be reborn as a fly.
The fly would return to you so I could tell where you were...
But this isn't good.
I just got done saying we wouldn't involve any civilians...
But my bad. That was a lie.
so I hope you can just deal with it.
Giorno Giovanna, I can see your ability is not to be underestimated.
You leave me no choice.
but it seems I'll have to take care of you right here, right now.
I can't let you escape.
I'm pretty determined about that.
Let me escape?
The only thing you have to worry about
is what you'll do once your body parts have been zipped apart all over the ground.
This battle will be decided by who hits the other first.
What's the matter?
Come at me, Giorno Giovanna.
Useless!
Thud
Just your senses will go berserk.
"You hit me first, so how?"
I don't blame you for wondering that.
This isn't my arm.
My Zipper Man's ability allows two separate things to be connected with a zipper.
This is that kid's arm.
I switched it out with mine.
Because, of course, I'd rather avoid the danger of being hit with your ability.
That's why your Golden Wind didn't work.
What are you trying to do, Giorno Giovanna?!
I'm ending you right now!
Unbelievable... He ripped off his own arm
to extend his range a bit further and strike a moment faster...
Golden Wind!
I-It's happening again!
H-He's going to get me!
The destructive power of Giorno Giovanna's Stand ability isn't too great...
But in this case, that actually makes things worse!
If I have to experience that slow pain not once, but multiple times...
I'll probably die from the shock of the pain!
Don't!
Stop!
He went out of range?
What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!
Why did you stop attacking me?
Why didn't you finish me off?!
Because you're a good person.
You're in a gang, but you're a good person.
so I decided I wouldn't attack you, either.
you were shocked to see the state it was in
and stopped attacking for a moment.
You were shocked that he'd been shooting up drugs.
How old is he?
Thirteen.
I probably would've been rolling around on the ground in pieces.
But you seem different.
There are people in this city who would sell drugs to kids.
They're unforgivable.
That's what you believe.
But the one selling those drugs is your boss.
You can't help but feel conflicted about that.
That's why your heart ached when you saw his arm.
So what? That's got nothing to do with me eliminating you.
I've been ordered to find the one who attacked Luca and eliminate them!
Just because you stopped attacking me doesn't mean I'm not going to kill you!
No...
What?
You won't kill me. I know it.
Why do you say that?
Because you're going to join me.
I plan on defeating your boss and taking over this city.
What?!
I'm going to have to become a gangster myself.
Are you saying...
Are you serious?!
What a great view...
I'll have to join the organization that rules it and work my way up.
Episodio 03 Meet the Gangster Behind the Wall
Because you're going to join me.
I plan on defeating your boss and taking over this city.
What?!
I'm going to have to become a gangster myself.
Are you saying...
that you're going to join our organization?!
Are you serious?!
Do you even know what that means?!
What a great view...
I'll have to join the organization that rules it and work my way up.
I'm going to become a Gang-Star!
Pass! Pass!
Thanks!
Thanks.
Thanks!
Fine.
I'll report back saying I couldn't find the one who attacked Luca
and introduce you so you can join the organization.
However, if they find out at any time that you're going after the boss...
I'm not going to save you.
Traitors can't be saved.
You'll have to deal with your own failure.
Otherwise, I'll wager on your golden dream and
Giorno Giovanna.
Meet the Gangster Behind the Wall
Our organization oversees every industry in Naples.
Passione... That's the name of the organization.
Passione means "passion," but that's not actually related to the boss's name.
No one actually knows the boss's name, nor does anyone know what he looks like.
We receive orders from a number of his capos.
Giorno, the capo who'll be deciding whether you'll join the organization
He's in this building.
But this building...
Loom
It's a prison.
Correct. Polpo was convicted of a certain crime
But he gives me orders from the inside and commands the organization.
He can leave this place whenever he feels like it, but he doesn't.
There's simply no reason to.
But why?
You'll understand once you go in.
Giorno Giovanna, you're going to be interviewed by him, and you have to pass.
It's basically like any other job interview.
but whatever you do, don't let him find out your true intentions.
All right.
Oh, yeah. The Stand ability...
but are there others with it?
That'll also be answered once you get inside...
If you pass, that is.
then proceed to the next room for a body check.
Stand right there and raise your hands over your head.
Once you go through that gate, please continue straight down the hall.
N-28 is where Polpo's cell is.
The room is divided with reinforced glass, but you'll be able to talk to him.
You have fifteen minutes.
Once you pass through, the gate will close.
If something happens, please yell.
I'm going to meet him directly in his cell?
Not in some visiting room?
You don't know who he is?
That left arm of yours...
That's no bed...
Gwooo
but the fingers are slightly red, like you were holding something.
Like lines that would be left after holding a bag.
Which would mean that you were holding a bag in your right hand up until now.
Why's that?
Well, uh... You're right.
because as you observed, I hurt my left arm.
I envy your ability to be so reckless with your body.
Would you like some wine?
It pairs perfectly with some Scamorza cheese and caviar on a cracker.
I've been told that I'm not allowed
They're just saying that.
What people say and what they do...
are vastly different.
That's the best and worst thing about people.
The only downside to being in this cell is.... well...
Polpo...
The fact that I can't admire Michelangelo's great painting in the Sistine Chapel.
Things would just be the same for him whether he left or not.
With that body, he might actually be safer in the cell.
More importantly, how did he get through the door?
Bucciarati's told me all about you.
So you want to join our organization?
Well, why don't we get this interview started?
What the hell was that?
For a moment, it looked like he took a bite out of his finger along with the cracker...
No... Maybe Polpo is also a Stand user, just like Bucciarati.
Either way, I can't let him find out that I'm one, as well.
What do you think is the most important thing
Is it what they're capable of?
Oh? And what exactly are you capable of?
I borrowed a few things when she was patting me down.
I thought these would be useful for your test.
Of course, I'll be returning them to her when I leave.
Do you have anything else?
Other than that, the only skill I have
That's rather amusing.
But, you see...
and that's trust, Giorno Giovanna.
The most important thing when it comes to choosing people is trust.
In comparison, being smart or being talented means as much
This test is all about seeing how trustworthy you are...
with this lighter's flame.
Take it, and make sure the flame doesn't go out.
Whoa, there.
For 24 hours, you will hold on to that lighter without letting the flame go out.
If you can do that, I'll approve of you joining the organization.
Simple, right?
All you have to do is sit quietly in your room until 3 PM tomorrow
Which means you're someone we can trust.
However...
or a sudden wind blows the flame out...
and I can't allow you to join our organization.
Now, take the lighter.
This is your entrance exam.
You have 24 hours.
I'm looking forward to seeing you come to visit me again tomorrow at 3 PM.
For 24 hours...
All visitors must go through another body check when they go through the gate.
please continue to the next room and grab your belongings.
Wait! Polpo didn't tell you anything?
What?
I'm going to pat you down now.
Let me remind you that it's prohibited for you to accept anything from him!
Visitor, put your hands up and proceed forward!
So Polpo's test for me has already started...
And...
I have no choice but to go through with it!
I have to pass this test and get into Passione!
Koichi Hirose
Reverb Act 3
Visitor, hurry forward!
Put your hands up and proceed forward! I will conduct a body check!
I'll hide this flame!
You're free to go.
You may leave this facility.
However...
Please open up your hand.
Let me remind you that it's prohibited to accept anything from him.
Visitor, open up your hand! I'm going to check it.
A flower?
A real flower?
Very well. I'll allow you to take that out.
You are permitted to leave this facility.
I turned the lighter into a flower and hid the flame within it.
That was too close.
But is this flame Polpo's Stand ability?
The wind's definitely bad news!
Hey, Giorno! Perfect timing!
Could you push the shutter button on the camera?
No.
Sorry, but could you help me out here?
No.
I finally made it back to my dorm.
Th-That was close...
Now, just as Polpo said, I just need to watch over this for the next 23 hours.
I know.
I need to make sure it doesn't randomly open and allow the wind to blow in here.
What?
Th-That's—
Looks like he's out.
Now's my chance.
It's that Japanese guy again!
His name was... Koichi Hirose!
How did he find out my address?
Looks like my suitcase and belongings are long gone.
But my passport might still be around.
It's probably harder to sell someone's ID.
I feel like a thief, sneaking into someone's room like this, but...
No! He's the thief here!
What's so wrong with trying to find what belongs to me?!
His passport? Shit!
It's in the documents case on top of my desk because
At this rate, Koichi's going to see the lighter's flame!
Then he'll probably put it out!
He'll think it'll set the place on fire!
What should I do?
Golden Wind!
I used Golden Wind to turn the light cord into a snake.
That bread is pretty delicious.
Now I'll pull it up with the cord...
What? Shit!
I can't believe this.
I have to make sure he doesn't blow the flame out!
Oh?
This mark! The mark symbolizing Japan!
I found it! It's my passport!
I-It's burning!
Thank goodness...
That's strange. I could've sworn I saw a lit lighter...
That was close.
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!
I have to protect this flame, no matter what!
Whoa, that was close.
Sorry about that. I was cleaning the stairs.
I'm glad it was just a slight mist and the water didn't actually hit you.
This must mean we've both done good things in our daily lives.
Your daily actions are very important.
If you weren't careful, you'd probably be wearing that bucket of water on your head.
Seriously? This isn't good.
I wonder if I can ask Polpo to let me try again.
If he were that forgiving, he wouldn't have tested me with this.
Flame?
Is that lighter not lighting up anymore?
Is it broken? Is it my fault?
No, it wasn't you.
But from what I can see, it doesn't look broken.
What did you just say?
Whoosh
Yes, there's still gas coming out.
Did you try pushing it?
No... It shouldn't be able to light.
But look at this fine craftsmanship!
This whole test depended on if the flame was lit or not.
It's a very impressive lighter.
If I were able to just light it again, there's be no point in this test!
I was startled by the size of the flame, but it looks like it's working fine.
See?
By the way, since you have that lighter, you're not smoking cigarettes, are you?
Something's wrong.
What the...
That couldn't be his Sta—
You relit the lighter, didn't you?
I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths.
Th-That's...
The first path is to live and become a chosen one.
Your only other path is death.
A Stand!
You relit the lighter!
This is your fate!
No way! You bastard! What the hell are you doing?!
This soul...
One who should be chosen?
H-Hey, are you...
He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...
Was it because...
That Stand pulls people's souls out and kills them with an arrow?
Is that it?
But does "the one who should be chosen"
You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?
I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...
Episodio 04 Joining the Gang
Something's wrong.
It actually lit up again... There has to be something wrong!
You relit the lighter, didn't you?
No way! You bastard! What the hell are you doing?!
This soul...
did not belong to one who should be chosen.
One who should be chosen?
H-Hey, are you...
He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...
You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?
I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...
So it indiscriminately attacks anyone who happens to see the lighter relit.
Th-This is...
This bastard... He's dragging my soul
out of me through my shadow!
I'll give you one more chance. You have two possible paths...
Episodio 04 Joining the Gang
The first path is to become a chosen one.
It's no use... It's stronger than Golden Wind.
The old man died after his soul was struck by that arrow.
So what's going to happen to me
Your only other path is death.
Th-This arrow...
If I actually get stabbed by that arrow, I'm dead for sure!
I've got no choice!
if he's going to stand in my way
I have to defeat him!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Golden Wind...
It's gone! That's impossible!
It shouldn't be able to control its own movements right now.
Even if it were able to move, it should be extremely slow.
It shouldn't be able to disappear!
It has to be around here somewhere...
or it'll attack me again.
What?!
F-From within the shadows?! Sh-Shit!
Its movements are slower, but it's still just as powerful!
I can't move at all!
The shadows! It's in the shadows!
It can only move within the shadows, but at amazing speed...
Looks like it can't follow me into the sunlight.
But the sun's going to set on the other side of the school soon.
Once that happens, I'll have nowhere to run.
What'll happen if I force it out into the sunlight?
It's definitely worth trying.
But how am I going to drag it out?
What should I do? It's waiting right there.
It's waiting there patiently
Hey!
What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!
Koichi!
Who's that guy collapsed at the bottom of the stairs?!
What did you do to him?!
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!
That wasn't me!
That Stand right there atta—
The wrong idea?
I saw you talking to that old man!
I was watching from the window!
You were... watching?
Then... did you see the lighter being relit, too?
Huh?
Don't step into the handrail's shadow, Koichi!
Get out of the shadows!
Sh-Shit!
You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?
You have two possible paths.
Wh-What's going on?
The first path is to become a chosen one.
Your only other path is death.
This arrow is...
Golden Wind!
It hurts so much...
it looks like I was able to drag you out into the sunlight.
I turned part of the handrail
Now you're out of the handrail's shadow!
So close!
Wh-What was...
What was that Stand?!
As you saw, it's trying to attack us.
The old man who relit this lighter was killed.
both you and I are now its targets.
That's not what I meant.
That arrow... It's from Bow and Arrow!
I didn't know one was in Italy, too...
What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!
Is it because of you that another Stand with the arrow appeared?!
It'll take too long to explain everything...
Do you know something about that Stand?
And about that arrow?
Why did you save me?
Telling me about that arrow is more important!
The sun's going to set!
Why did you save me?!
Don't you dare assume that I feel like I owe a thief like you anything!
The lighter being lit is because of something I did.
There was nothing I could've done for that old man.
I feel awful about it.
I believe what I did was right, but I feel dark and gross inside.
Two years ago, I was shot with a similar arrow and gained my Stand ability.
If the person shot with the arrow doesn't awaken to that ability, they will die.
Awaken to the ability?
That's it!
That's what it meant by the "chosen one"!
Someone whose Stand awakened!
And that must be the motive behind Polpo's test!
but I've met a Stand very similar to this one before.
It's a long-distance remote-controlled Stand!
Long-distance and remote-controlled?
Our best option is to find the Stand user and take them down.
Sadly, that's not an option.
The user is in a jail cell. We can't get to him.
and then we'll get rid of that shadow.
That way, we can drag it into the sunlight.
Got it!
I-It's gone!
I've got you!
Wh-What?!
You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?
The crows!
It hid in the shadows of those crows and moved over there in them!
Th-This thing...
It's useless!
Sh-Shit!
While in the shadows, its power and speed are much higher!
Act 3! 3 Freeze!
My Reverb Act 3's ability is to make Stands or people heavier.
so much that it won't be able to lift a finger from the ground.
It should let go.
It shouldn't be able to bend its fingers anymore!
It's strong...
You have two possible paths...
I-It's no use!
At this rate, Giorno's legs are going to break!
Act 3! Undo 3 Freeze...
No.
Don't do that, Koichi.
This ability that makes things heavier... Don't you dare undo it.
This is perfect.
This is exactly the ability that I was looking for!
But your leg's going to shatter!
Wh-What?
That tree...
Ability?
But that tree's at least ten meters away...
So you got to the tree's roots by digging that hole!
Bam
Y-You did it! The shadow's gone!
It's been dragged out into the daylight!
but sadly, you only have one.
Koichi, could you move to the right a little?
Huh? Like this?
Hmm...
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Bask in the sunlight.
That's it.
That's your one possible path.
Still, I have to wonder
What to do...
Polpo
Shadow Sabbath
That arrow...
The fact that the Arrow is also in Italy means
that there'll be even more victims!
I need to hurry up and tell Jotaro!
Wh-What are you doing?
Did you just say there'll be more?
We defeated Polpo's Stand, which had the arrow.
Defeated? You've got this all wrong!
but that Stand only stopped attacking because of the sunlight.
The user isn't hurt at all. They're perfectly fine!
So Polpo's alive?
Not only that, but long-distance remote-controlled Stands
He probably hasn't even realized there's been a battle here.
What?
So he has no idea at all?
Chill out, would you?
but he'd have no way of knowing that you and I are Stand users.
Hey, could you move your finger?
Sorry, but I still can't let you make your call.
I'm begging you...
If you tell someone, the organization might find out.
Enemy?
I'll tell you and only you, Koichi.
The Next Day
Someone gifted me a special-order pizza.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's see, you were...
Giorno... Giorno, uh...
Giorno Giovanna.
Ah, yes. Sorry about that.
My head goes blank when I eat.
Perhaps it's because all my blood goes to my stomach.
This might sound sudden, but are you a religious person, Giorno?
I'm not sure... but I'm not very passionate about it.
but I'd like you to listen carefully.
the most despicable thing you can do is insult someone.
Listen well... To insult or betray someone's trust
but puts them in a very sticky situation.
or having our seats taken at a theater or on the bus.
But...
I believe that God forgives even murder.
Don't forget that.
Congratulations! I will allow you to enter the organization.
You did bring me the lighter still lit, as I trusted you would.
You pass.
That's our Passione organization's badge.
It proves that you passed.
You'll be working under Bucciarati for a while.
How about it? Why don't we celebrate your...
Did that brat actually protect the flame for 24 hours?
Or did he relight it and become a Stand user?
I couldn't care less about that.
Young, clueless guys like him are easy to use.
Either way, we can use him however we want.
Oh?
The blood does flow to my stomach after I've eaten...
You met him again?
I'm sorry, Jotaro.
But I can't help thinking
that he, Giorno Giovanna, isn't as dangerous as you think he might be.
What makes you think that?
Well...
Well, I'll tell you that in person.
Is that all right?
All right.
If that's what you want to do, that's fine.
I'll be waiting.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you later.
Jotaro, back then, I really did think...
Does this Giorno kid really admire that?
But I can feel it...
I can feel that he has a righteous heart.
I can tell...
Because I observed three members of the Joestar bloodline back in Morioh.
The three who exude righteousness from their hearts, as if it were their life energy.
I could see the same thing in his eyes.
Without a doubt, the blood that flows in his veins carries the will of the Joestars.
So I'm going to keep this to myself for a while, like he asked...
The golden dream that Giorno Giovanna possesses.
Well, then, maybe I'll go do some sightseeing.
The Next Day
Come with me, Giorno Giovanna.
What was that noise?
Well, whatever.
When someone insults you, even murder is forgivable?
I see. What you told me is very important.
You insulted that innocent old man's life.
So I changed one of your guns into a banana.
You should savor your last meal as best you can.
So... Where are we going?
I'll introduce you to my team.
They're all Stand users.
Episodio 05 Find Polpo's Fortune!
Passione is a pretty big gang organization.
First, there are groups made up of six to ten underlings, like my team.
Then there are capos like Polpo who command those teams.
They reign over a particular region, making it their turf.
These teams include specialty teams, such as an assassination team and a drug team.
And the one who stands at the top is the boss.
and we have no way of knowing who or where he is.
as it can quickly lead to their assassination.
and some even have cover jobs.
That goes double for our boss. He won't reveal his identity to anyone.
If we go snooping around, we're detected immediately.
I know plenty of guys this has happened to.
We can't defeat the boss unless we earn the acknowledgement
So first, we're going to get stronger.
We have to climb up to the position of capo.
Of course, the two of us can't do that alone.
A team we can trust...
That's what we'll need to defeat the boss.
Episodio 05 Find Polpo's Fortune!
The news of the incarcerated Polpo's death spread among the other capos.
According to our intelligence team, it might've been suicide.
That's not his style.
Polpo was in a special cell. Murder isn't possible.
Maybe he was plotting to betray the boss.
There aren't many capos as trustworthy as him.
That's even less believable.
More importantly...
Yeah... The problem is his successor.
How do I look?
Rome 10:05 a.m.
I just heard that the capos are freaking out.
Apparently, Polpo committed suicide.
Huh?
Hey, watch where you're going!
I'm fine.
Suicide? That fatso?
I told you to watch where you're going!
but he apparently wasn't very strong mentally.
He put his own gun in his mouth and blew his brains out.
You sure it was suicide and not murder?
It was suicide, for sure. From the... autopsy, they call it?
Any expert can tell if it was a suicide or murder.
Hey, there's a light up ahead.
More importantly, have you heard the rumors about Polpo's fortune?
Rumors?
and hid them somewhere.
He has a hidden fortune.
It's too much to even deposit in the bank, and he kept it secret from the organization.
No one was stupid enough to look for it while Polpo was alive.
But now that he's dead, that fortune doesn't belong to anyone.
It's free money.
It's said to be worth about five billion lire.
Five billion?
Nah, I'd rather work my way up.
If I can climb up to capo with that money, I can taste honey that's even sweeter.
But who knows where it's hidden...
No one knows?
Nah, and this is just what I'm thinking...
But Polpo was such a fatty, he couldn't even go outside on his own.
Do you think he could hide a fortune worth five billion on his own?
He must've had someone do it for him.
Someone who's good at keeping their mouth shut...
Though I'm not sure anyone like that actually exists.
But Polpo liked Bucciarati.
Bucciarati? That's one of the thugs from Naples, right?
Yeah. If anyone could've hidden it, it's him.
And now that Polpo's dead, Bucciarati should be making his move...
to get the five billion lire that's just been freed up.
I'm sure that even Bucciarati wants money.
Hey, Zucchero!
That bastard Zucchero actually left!
If you're actually going to trail Bucciarati, I'd be careful.
Apparently, he and his subordinates are Stand users.
Naples 11:26 a.m.
Hey, Fugo.
It's such a nice day outside.
I'm just not feeling it today.
Thank you for waiting. Here's your strawberry cake.
Listen, Narancia.
Set it there.
Yes, sir.
You're amazing.
It's hard to ask someone to teach you something
But you even learned your multiplication tables!
You can do this. Just do as I've taught you.
You've got a good head on your shoulders.
Okay, ready? What's six times five?
Six times five... Six and five...
Thirty?
Correct! See? I knew you could do it!
You're basically halfway there!
I see! Six times five is thirty! Okay!
Hey, what's the deal with this?!
What do you mean? It's strawberry cake.
Yeah, I can see that by looking at it!
It's obviously not chocolate cake or cheesecake!
That's not the point here!
There are four slices of cake!
Do they want me to die?!
Again with this, Mista?
You moron!
Choosing from five is fine.
Choosing from three is fine.
But when you choose from four, something bad will happen!
When I was a kid, another kid adopted a kitten from
and then the cat scratched his eye right out of his head!
Of course, he beat the cat to death later.
That's just an old wives' tale.
That's the thing, though!
This is when the restaurant should be more considerate and just bring us three slices!
Talk about shitty service!
Jeez... Don't eat it, then.
But I want some strawberry cake!
I did it!
I did it, Fugo! How's it look?
You're finished? Let's have a look.
What is this?
Am I right?
Crunch
You stupid delinquent! Are you messing with me?!
How many times do I have to teach you this before you learn?!
You shit-for-brains!
Oh, boy. He's lost it now.
You just said six times five was thirty, so why the hell is your answer even less?!
Hey, Abbacchio, are you gonna eat that cake?
What?
Did you just call me shit-for-brains?
It's not good to look down on others.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Fugo.
You bastard...
What the hell are you guys doing?!
I could hear you all the way from the entrance!
You're bothering the other customers!
This is the new member I told you about yesterday.
Let me introduce you. This is Giorno Giovanna.
I'm Giorno Giovanna.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry, Fugo.
No, I should apologize.
Please forgive me, Narancia.
I'll study even harder, so teach me again.
Hey!
I'm the one who brought him here, so be respectful!
Mr. Bucciarati.
What is it?
There's a phone call for you.
All right, thanks.
Make sure you guys properly greet Giorno! Got it?
Giorno, I'll be right back.
Take some time to get to know these guys.
All right.
Giorno, was it?
Why don't you have a seat?
Let's have some tea and chat.
Here you go, Mr. Bucciarati.
Thanks.
This is Bucciarati.
All right.
Is something wrong?
No.
Bucciarati! Bucciarati, do you have a second?
Oh, hello, Ms. Menini.
What's the matter?
I'd like to ask a favor. Could we talk outside?
Of course.
Well, drink up.
How old are you?
Fifteen.
Fifteen? Ha, you're two years younger than me.
Thank you for the tea.
What's wrong?
Since you already thanked me for it, you'll just have to drink it.
Or do you not want to drink it since it's not very hot?
Maybe he doesn't want to drink it because he doesn't want to be one of us.
What the hell are you guys doing?!
It's nothing.
He went to the trouble of pouring this tea for me.
No freakin' way!
What did you guys do?
Gross! He actually drank it!
D-Dude, you're hilarious! Did you seriously drink it?
No, there's no way he could have!
Hey, how'd you do it? Where'd you hide it?
Hey, come on. Just tell me! Okay?
Who knows?
So he's a Stand user?
What I did with the liquid in the cup is...
Is it, like, some ability to move things?
Open your mouth. There's no hole in there, is there?
You actually drank it for real?
but there's something about Giorno Giovanna that makes him hard to dislike.
If you guys tell me about your powers, I might tell you mine.
You're cautious. I respect that.
Does Bucciarati know?
Yeah.
They're not exactly a team yet, but we don't have any time to wait.
This has to be decided now.
Quit screwing around. We're going out.
Huh? Where?
Follow me and you'll find out. Hurry it up.
Bucciarati! How are you?
Oh, Mr. Bucciarati!
Hey, Bucciarati.
Come by my shop again sometime!
I will!
Hey, what are we going to do about a car?
We got a loaner.
Since a certain someone destroyed our last one.
As I suspected, the citizens trust him.
Hey, I told you that wasn't my fault!
and she's in a bit of trouble because her son is beating her.
Right?
I see. That's rough.
I'll give him a talking-to.
Thank you.
He's usually such a sweet boy.
Bucciarati, I've been living in this neighborhood for fifty years.
But lately, I've been so anxious.
Who's making them sell those drugs?
I'm so scared.
Hey, you're going to protect us, aren't you, Bucciarati?
You're on our side, right?
Yeah... I'll take care of it.
I'll figure it out.
We're going cruising on a yacht?
When did you get a yacht?
We're going to rent one.
Huh?
Aw, it's just a rental.
Say, Bucciarati...
Whatever you do, please don't rent that one with the number 4.
It'll sink. I know it.
Oh, come on... If that were the case, it wouldn't be floating there now.
Shut up!
Then can ride on that one!
We'd like to rent a yacht.
Of course! You can use whichever one you like.
Other than 4!
All right. Sir, I'd like the one on the far left.
All right. Let me get you the key.
For now, I'd like to rent it for three days. How much will that cost?
Oh, I could never ask you for money, Mr. Bucciarati!
Use it as long as you'd like.
Thanks.
Ring me up, pops!
This feels nice.
Hey, Narancia... Hey!
Huh?
Well, uh, you know...
You bought drinks, didn't you? Would you sell me one?
What? You always say that, but you never pay!
Oh, who cares? Gimme one! Come on, hurry! Gimme!
You're so helpless.
You want a cola or Sparite?
I'll take a co— Actually, a Sparite, since it's clear.
Here you go.
Thanks. Could you hold this magazine for me?
Thanks, and thanks again...
Huh? What's wrong with this thing? It just stopped working!
I just bought it!
Damn it! How dare he sell me something like this?!
That stupid old guy from the electronics store is gonna regret this!
Hey!
Come on, Bucciarati! Hurry up and tell us where this boat's headed!
Fine. We're far enough away from the shore now.
We're headed to Capri.
Capri?
We're not going there as tourists, are we?
Correct.
Then why are we going there?
This morning, the capo Polpo committed suicide.
What? Suicide?! Polpo did?
No way!
But why?
It doesn't matter why he died.
Polpo was a capo who did things that'd get him killed.
But what does he have to do with why we're going to Capri?
Polpo actually has a secret fortune.
It's worth...
ten billion lire!
T-Ten billion?
I'm the only person who knows where it's hidden.
I'm the one he ordered to hide it.
That ten billion now belongs to us!
With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!
A-Awesome!
He's definitely a man who's going to the top.
Just like I thought, he's going to become a capo!
He earned this opportunity
by working diligently enough to be acknowledged and liked by a capo.
Amazing.
Seriously? This took a sudden turn for the awesome.
Where is it?
Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?
I can't tell you that yet.
Rumors of his hidden fortune have made the rounds in the organization.
No one can find out before we secure the money.
B-Bucciarati!
Hey! Something's wrong!
Did something happen, Narancia?
Narancia!
What the heck are you doing?
H-Hey, come look at this!
There's only one shoe left...
Give that here, Giorno!
I don't quite understand what's going on.
Where did Narancia go?
You guys didn't see it?
To me, it looked like Narancia got pulled into this box.
What?
That's impossible!
Narancia, where are you?
Hey, Narancia! If you're just fooling around and hiding... Hup!
Hurry up and answer us!
Narancia, where are you?
Narancia! Answer us!
Mista?
What are you doing, Mista?
Mista?
Where did you go, Mista?
It can't be...
Come on, Mista!
Why are you messing around now—
Fugo?
Hey, Fugo!
What?
What's going on?
Abbacchio, Giorno, stay close to each other!
We're being attacked!
There's someone hiding somewhere on this boat!
This is a Stand attack!
But why now?
The money.
and they're trying to steal it.
Which means they're from the organization.
Does that mean they've been quietly tracking us ever since we were on the shore?
Looks that way.
They probably grew impatient because I wouldn't just say where the money is.
They intend to get rid of everyone but me, then make me cough up the location.
And they can take their time, since we're on the ocean with nowhere to run.
Are you saying Narancia and the others are dead?
I didn't say that.
But it's for ten billion.
No, Narancia and the others are alive.
They're somewhere on this boat.
but they're alive.
how the hell can you be so sure about that?
I used my Stand to turn Narancia's shoe into a fly.
The fly is trying to return to its owner, Narancia.
If Narancia was truly dead, it wouldn't be flying around searching like that.
Can you locate him?
He's alive... He's alive, but...
It's not going down into the cabin or in the locker.
The fly's not trying to stop...
It keeps flying around that area looking for Narancia.
What the hell is his ability?
Just shut up and listen.
Narancia is somewhere near the entrance to the cabin.
That's a fact.
But for some reason, the fly can't find him, so it's lost.
I think it's safe to assume that we'll find the enemy wherever Narancia is.
Which means the enemy isn't just randomly hiding behind something.
I see.
getting too close without knowing could get us killed.
Correct.
If we can figure out the mystery behind it, we'll be able to defeat them.
Abbacchio, your Stand...
might be perfect to defeat such an enemy.
Defeat?
Can you solve this mystery with your ability?
Hard to say...
Damn it, Abbacchio!
You'd better not be hung up on stupid shit at a time like this!
Stupid shit?
This has to do with my safety.
I can't just carelessly reveal my Stand ability
in front of a stranger that I can't trust.
but I don't consider him a part of the team.
If we don't figure out the enemy's location, we're going to be killed!
And I'm saying that's just this untrustworthy brat's hypothesis.
He just came up with it out of fear. He didn't see anything.
Abbacchio!
The enemy is just hiding somewhere in the cabin.
I'll find them and take care of them.
If we get close without figuring out the mystery, we're going to get kil—
Shut your mouth!
You stupid little brat...
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.
What are you talking about?
You can solve the mystery, right?
I'm counting on you!
Giorno!
What the hell are you doing?!
Roar
G-Giorno!
There's an enemy over there!
Shit!
Giorno's in trouble!
Abbacchio...
Giorno Giovanna... You're one crazy bastard.
All this to prove yourself...
What the hell is wrong with you?
Episodio 06 Moody Jazz's Counterattack
Leone Abbacchio became a police officer after graduating from high school.
This was due to his strong sense of justice.
Abbacchio realized there were many contradictions that came with this job.
while those very people they were risking their lives to protect
Hey, you two!
and throwing rocks at police cars, breaking their windshields.
Honey!
Are you all right?
Hey, you!
You're a cop, aren't you?!
asking, "What are the police even doing?!"
"Serial Burglar Isacco Finally Arrested!"
"A Whole Group Wiped Out"
"Isacco Released on 70 Million Lire" "Victims Furious"
and they would be released.
Quit causing us so much trouble.
My bad.
It doesn't matter now.
We just have to find more people to rip off.
Eventually, Abbacchio started to learn from these contradictions.
Come on, Officer.
Cut us some slack.
That girl's father is swimming in debt, so she needs the cash.
It's not like we're hurting anyone.
Hey, are you done yet?
I've got a client waiting.
I know, I know.
Even if I were to arrest them, they'd just post bail and be released.
The only difference is they pay either me or the court and their lawyers.
and a very passionate police officer.
One night, they received a report that a shop was being robbed.
Abbacchio! Go around the back.
Freeze! You're under arrest!
H-Hey, it's you.
Looks like I messed up.
You're...
He's been shot in the head.
Hey, couldn't you just pretend that you didn't see me?
Come on, let me go.
I won't cause you any more trouble.
No! You're under arrest!
Come on, think this through...
If I get arrested, the fact that you took a bribe from me will get out, too.
That gun's really dangerous...
Could you point it somewhere else?
Abbacchio! He has a gun!
Ow! It hurts, God damn it!
I'm gonna die...
I'm gonna die...
I'm gonna die...
I'm really gonna die...
That moment was the end of Abbacchio's future.
and that was a cross he'd have to bear for the rest of his life.
It was then that his body and soul plunged into darkness.
his heart would probably never be moved again.
Abbacchio, wasn't it?
Episodio 06 Moody Jazz's Counterattack
You can solve the mystery, right?
I'm counting on you!
Giorno!
What the hell are you doing?!
Roar
G-Giorno!
Giorno's in trouble!
Giorno Giovanna...
You're one crazy bastard.
All this to prove yourself...
What the hell is wrong with you?
Y-You bastard...
Th-This Stand...
Use your Golden Wind to defend yourself!
I-Impossible!
Giorno... Where are you?!
Don't go down there, Bucciarati.
Actually, stay back.
but Giorno seems to believe that you won't abandon him.
He does some pretty crazy shit.
Giorno Giovanna...
What if that had actually killed you?
So, again, Bucciarati, don't go down there.
Th-That fly...
Narancia's shoe...
Giorno's powers haven't disappeared yet.
Does that mean Giorno's alive?
They're here, Bucciarati!
Narancia and the enemy are below deck!
Zipper Man!
Narancia, Fugo, Mista, and Giorno aren't here!
Maybe they're right under where the fly is.
It's just like Giorno said.
The enemy's not just hiding in some locker or behind something to attack...
Hey. The fly's coming around now.
That's strange...
Where is the enemy going?
How and where is the enemy hiding?
Regarding this enemy's abilities...
I hate to admit it, but it looks like I'll have to accept what Giorno was saying.
I'll use my Stand to solve this mystery!
But... This spot's bad news, Bucciarati!
Moody Jazz!
Does Narancia from five minutes ago work?
Yeah. That should be fine.
Is the fly all right?
It's heading toward the bow.
Now's our chance. Do it quickly.
Yeah.
What's that noise?
His headphones.
Five minutes ago, Narancia was listening to his boombox.
Huh? What's wrong with this thing? It just stopped working!
Why'd it stop?
This isn't it.
I just bought it!
Narancia was attacked a little after this.
Damn it! How dare he sell me something like this?!
I'll try fast forwarding and searching.
That stupid old guy from the electronics store is gonna regret this!
That ten billion now belongs to us!
With that money, we can claim the rank of capo!
A-Awesome!
Where is it?
That was my voice.
Where'd you hide that kind of fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?
It was right after this conversation that Narancia was attacked!
I can't tell you that yet.
We'd better be able to see just how he was attacked, Abbacchio.
My Stand replays everything.
We'll be able to see everything, from Narancia's sweat to his pulse.
And it'll follow him everywhere.
It's about time.
Let's get behind Narancia.
He's about to be attacked!
L-Look! It's the same wound Giorno had!
Roar!
It's coming!
Th-This is...
He's deflating like a balloon losing air!
Mario Zucchero
Tender Machine
Air is leaking from his wound, deflating him.
Looks like we know what the enemy's abilities are now.
He's being pulled in!
Pause it, Abbacchio!
I see... So he's inside the pipe.
This is the answer to our mystery.
but he still has a pulse.
Just like Giorno said, he's alive.
So that's what's going on...
and he's dragged in Mista, Fugo, and Giorno, as well.
but can't pinpoint exactly where they are.
We figured out the enemy's ability.
and then beat the shit out of the guy.
I'm resuming Moody Jazz's replay.
Chase? Wait a second, Abbacchio!
While you're replaying, you can't attack or defend yourself. You're totally defenseless!
It's dangerous to go into the pipe.
I know exactly where Moody Jazz is going.
When that bastard is near, use your zippers to open the floor and get him!
We can't defeat the enemy if we don't chase him, Bucciarati!
It went left.
That's where he got Mista.
Moody Jazz is going right underneath that ring buoy.
It's going around toward the cabin where it got Fugo and Giorno.
So the enemy is moving them around while keeping them captured.
It's moving much slower...
That's where the bastard was hiding earlier.
On the inside of that rope fastener!
The enemy's right below the deck there!
The enemy's coming for us.
I'm not sure if he knows that we know his ability, but...
Bring it on!
The pipes! Cut through them and get them outta there!
Zipper Man!
Th-They're not there!
Where's the enemy, Abbacchio?
Where's your Moody Jazz? Where are they?
Right there.
It's my Stand. I know where it is.
It's right around there.
Right around where?
I'm telling you, right where you opened up!
My Moody Jazz is definitely right there!
Where are they?
Where are they?
Impossible... It's definitely right here.
Does this mean there's a mystery we haven't solved yet?
This isn't good!
Undo the replay and call your Stand back!
I already did.
Something's wrong...
What wall is this?
Where the hell are you?
Did you hear that, Bucciarati?
That's the sound of the inside of a pipe.
We can't see it, but Moody Jazz is definitely right there...
inside the pipe.
What are you doing?
The enemy's right there!
The pipe's wide open, but it's in the pipe...
It's coming closer...
So it's right here...
We need to run!
Run?
That Giorno Giovanna, whom I hate, told me to solve this mystery.
but I'm going to solve it!
Abbacchio...
It's coming!
There's one more mystery surrounding this enemy.
I'm finally starting to see it.
I'll solve this and kill that bastard!
That awkward feeling I got when I saw the mast...
Back then...
Bzzz
It's right there! Call back your Stand!
I've figured out the other mystery!
Abbacchio...
Kill him... Bucciarati!
This mystery...
The place the enemy's hiding...
You're being dragged in! Grab on to me!
Damn it!
He's not there...
Where did he go?
What?
You bastard...
Where did you take Abbacchio?!
He's not in the cabin or the drainage pipe...
Where are you hiding Abbacchio and the others?!
The fact that there are seagulls flying around...
must mean we're getting close to shore.
Looks like you're finally all alone, Bucciarati.
You bas—
Oh, hang on one sec.
Ah, ah, ah!
I'm the one who's gonna do the talking here.
Shut your trap until I tell you to answer my questions, damn it!
Very good.
but in suspended animation.
all chopped up nicely so the fishies could eat them easier.
Depending on your actions, I may even consider turning your crew back to normal.
All you have to do is tell me where Polpo's secret fortune is!
Are you from Passione?
You really...
don't get it at all.
I'll murder you, you little shit!
Listen up! All you're allowed to say is where the money is!
Just try and utter any other word from that asshole of a mouth!
For every word you say, I'll kill one of your friends!
Say, "What?" and I'll kill them!
Stay silent, and I'll kill them!
If I find out you're lying later, I'll kill them again!
Got it?
Speak cautiously and very carefully.
Now, then, let me ask you...
Where's the money hidden?
Black-tailed gulls.
Sorry, where?
Those aren't seagulls.
They're black-tailed gulls.
How do you tell them apart?
The ones that sound like they're meowing are black-tailed gulls.
You called them seagulls, but you were wrong.
They're black-tailed gulls.
I'm gonna kill one now!
Just try it! Better hope you don't get dragged down!
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!
I didn't punch the deck earlier to find where Abbacchio was.
It was to put a hole in the bottom of the boat.
A h-hole?!
and he was kind enough to show me...
where you are and how to know for sure.
It was Abbacchio's blood.
Abbacchio intentionally hurt his hand and showed me the blood trail.
The blood trail didn't go down below the deck!
It was cut off right on the deck!
So what does that mean, and where was he dragged to?
I rented the yacht that was on the left.
Abbacchio realized that when he looked up at the sky.
you'd best come out.
There were two boats!
Bwaaaaa
You bastard...
You were hiding by thinly covering this yacht with another one.
You were traveling through the thin gap between them and attacking us from there.
No wonder we couldn't figure it out. You get points for that.
Stay back, Bucciarati!
I'll kill your friends!
You should know better than anyone that
you couldn't survive in a gang if a measly little threat like that scared you.
Give up, and I'll forgive you.
But the moment you stab Abbacchio...
I will end your life.
Fwip
It's just as Giorno said.
The fact that you had to hide to attack is your weakness.
You're way too slow.
Pop
Abbacchio!
Well done...
what's important isn't the end result.
It's how you get there.
Join my team.
Don't die bound by your past.
Episodio 07 Six Bullets Appears, Part 1
Something isn't right.
I've felt someone's eyes on me since this morning.
But nobody could be out here.
I'm on a motorcycle in the middle of the open desert.
Who could be following me unseen?
There's no way.
It has to be my imagination.
You're a sharp one.
You sensed my presence, a feat even wild bats aren't able to accomplish.
Who the hell are you and why are you tailing me?!
I'm not tailing you!
I'm capturing you so our army can ask about Straizo, Joseph Joestar!
S-Straizo?!
Our army?!
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 12: The Pillar Man
By your face and accent, I'd say you're German.
What do you have to do with Straizo and Speedwagon?!
Come on! I'll beat some answers out of you!
You face the SS commando knife of I, Donobang, with your bare hands?
I feel insulted.
Come then, stripling!
Here! Have your flea-ridden magic carpet back!
A-A cactus!
Victory!
You'll need to do better than that to challenge me, you booger!
Now, my booger, say, "I completely agree, Herr Donobang."
I-I completely agree, Herr Donobang.
What's that? I can't hear you.
You're a very nimble fellow.
I wanted to save myself some trouble so I'm lying down here for safety.
What? You think you're safe there?
Have you lost your mind?
Wh-What's with this cactus?
Take a real close look.
The cactus was my goal all along!
Cacti are made up of 95% water and conduct Hamon fabulously.
Now, it's time to talk, Donobang!
Tell me everything you know.
I see.
When Speedwagon's body disappeared I had my hopes, but...
He really was safe.
Well. That's a fine piece of news.
Granny Erina will be pleased to hear it.
But who knows how the Germans are treating him?
I'll rescue him.
Then I'll rush home to see Granny Erina's smile!
D-Don't leave me!
Major von Stroheim, the pillar is cracking!
It now holds the blood of five prisoners.
The subject's capabilities are unknown.
How was the blood extracted?
No! Don't answer that! I can imagine.
Speedwagon.
Why so scared? Aren't you overreacting a bit?
Don't be too proud! He's dangerous!
Listen to me.
That room is a bunker.
Its iron walls are 50 cm thick!
It is equipped with flamethrowers, machine guns and time bombs.
What child fears a grizzly in a cage at the zoo?
None at all!
I believe he's nothing more than a cheap caveman who's lived too long!
Something's spraying out!
It's blood!
Use the sprinkler system!
His outer layer is taking on a flesh-like color and luster!
He's alive! He looks human!
He needs a name.
I, Stroheim, will be his godfather!
Let me think.
I'll name him after the Mexican sirocco! Santviento!
He's standing!
Stand up for us!
Show us what you are made of, Santviento!
Look at that! Our Santviento is quite the comedian, isn't he?!
The ultimate organism?! What's ultimate?!
Behold, Speedwagon!
He's sniffing around like a man barely out of the trees!
Do you think he has much brains?
This is a farce!
Whatever. Let's say he made the masks.
You, begin the experiment.
Yes, sir!
W-What is that?!
A prisoner. A prisoner with a mask, that is.
A-A vampire?
A few days ago, he was a feeble, toothless old man on death's door.
We haven't fed him today, so he must be thirsty.
How will they perform? Let's watch and see!
What's this? What a surprise!
Is he just an ordinary man?
We have no other subjects to test!
Shall we use the explosives planted in
Major?!
Very well. Do it!
W-Wait! Belay that order!
His jaw. L-Look at his lower jaw!
A-And his arms. Look! Look at his arms!
I thought he was losing the fight, but Santviento is absorbing the prisoner!
He is pulling him into his body.
He's eating the prisoner!
What a fantastic creature!
The masked man is his fodder!
Santviento feeds with his whole body!
T-That means he'll take in all of his prey's energy!
He ate him! He ate the masked man!
He ate him!
A-And he's grown!
Keep your head!
He only gained some weight after feeding.
And his intelligence?
What of his intelligence?
Is he capable of thought?
S-Stroheim.
What the...?! He spoke!
H-He said my name!
But he shouldn't be able to hear me in there!
My cactus pal Donobang said this is where the secret underground facility is.
Speedwagon has to be in there.
Now, how to get inside?
Vegetables, canned goods, meat, ham, eggs. That's a basket of food.
All right. Now we have to frisk you!
Don't make that face. Smile when I frisk you!
Raise your skirts! And smile!
Go on through!
Next!
I've brought you some tequila. Is that all right to bring through?
Put your hands up! You twitch and we shoot!
Why? Why are you panicking?!
That's a furtive movement!
Fire!
Hold it! I-I understand! I won't move!
Damn! Y-You Germans are too smart!
You saw right through my disguise!
You're nuts! Of course we did! What a creep!
No girl in the world is built like such an ox, you ox!
Look at yourself with clearer eyes, moron!
What was that?!
Hamon!
Oh, tacos!
Shoot, that was depressing.
I suppose they won't see through an army uniform.
W-What's going on?
I-I can't tell.
Weren't you watching?
Major von Stroheim, I was looking away for a moment.
You were here. Everyone was here.
But nobody saw.
This is no time for refreshments!
I-It was only a moment.
I only took my eyes off of him for a few seconds.
My vision is perfect, but I couldn't see what was happening inside!
This is unbelievable!
The chamber is sealed!
But the subject somehow escaped!
The walls show no damage!
Listen up! Calm down and search for him!
I am sure he's just concealed himself somewhere!
Cut off all oxygen! We'll wait for him to come out!
The film record is ready for viewing!
Show it to us!
Yes, sir!
Begin.
He's running for the wall!
H-He couldn't be...!
He's going into the ventilation ducts!
The entrance is only four by twenty centimeters!
But somehow he's stuffing himself into that tiny gap!
Incredible! He didn't just dislocate his joints!
H-He broke up his own skeleton to twist and alter his shape!
T-That means he's somewhere in the base's ventilation system!
The Pillar Man Santviento spoke your name earlier, Major von Stroheim.
He must have heard your name through the vents!
Do the vents lead here?!
Soldier! Stand away from that vent! You're in danger!
I-It's Santviento!
Major von Stroheim, did something happen?
It's so dark! I can't see!
Who turned out the lights?
Santviento crawled into the soldier's body!
Where is everybody?!
Don't leave me here all alone!
I'm not sure what's going on...
...but I've never felt so full of life!
What a nightmare.
If this creature escapes, it will be a dire foe to the Fatherland!
We must destroy it!
It has to be killed here and now!
Very well! Shoot him! Blast that soldier's body to pieces!
That tickles!
He's still alive!
I knew it!
He's immune to bullets!
What a monster!
Why is he pointing?
What's he gonna do?!
Wait! Do you think he's making a pistol?!
Is he imitating us?
W-When he spoke, he only said my name.
He's mimicking us!
It's just mindless aping.
That means he's not intelligent at all!
If he's only as smart as a monkey, perhaps we can still use him!
You...
Who among you disturbed my slumber?
H-He spoke!
He is capable of thought.
A-And his intelligence is great!
He has learned our speech in this short time!
Die!
What the...?
He took a bullet we shot at him and fired it back at us!
Hey, old man! Hide over here!
He's still got more bullets to fire!
No! I don't need any help from a German soldier!
Good heavens.
You never change.
Still stubborn at a time like this.
I-I can't handle this alone!
S-Stay away!
Hey, I need some of your hair! Just a handful or two!
Yeeowch! What are you doing?!
It'll only hurt for a bit.
You're assaulting an officer!
Who are you?
That brashness... It couldn't be...!
I call this one Hamon Hair Attack!
You're... You're...!
Joseph Joestar!
Barrier up!
I think you need to start moisturizing.
If you aren't careful, you'll go bald, Mr. German Army Man.
W-When did you get here?
Hey, old man!
Ha...ir...
Anyhow...
...what a scene I've dropped in on.
Next episode
His intelligence is incredible!
This is horrifying!
Now together, Santviento!
You primitive.
He's crawling into the wound in my leg!
Chapter 13: JoJo vs.The Ultimate Being
O-Ow! Hey, right here...
Hey, Fugo... Could you take a look right here?
Oh, dear. You've definitely got one.
It's pretty big.
Ow! That hurts!
Quit it! Don't touch it!
God damn it, you bastard!
You're gonna pay for that, you piece of shit!
I've got a bump on my head because of you!
I hope you're prepared!
Take this! And this!
Seriously! Who do you think you are?!
You bastard!
Hey, something fell off him.
Let's see...
Mario Zucchero. His home address is in Rome.
So he's a gangster from Rome.
So is that thing on your face garbage?
Or is it a piece of seaweed?
It looks like it could be seaweed, but it also looks like it could be a piece of plastic.
because it'd mean that this beautiful ocean is polluted.
Mind if I take a closer look at it?
Hey.
I asked you if you'd mind if I took a closer look at that.
Answer me when I ask you a question, would you?
Capri.
they looked for places with the most beautiful scenery in the world.
One of those locations happened to be Capri.
Its blue sea, its sparkling sky...
But in sharp contrast, it also had a shoreline
During the age of the Roman Empire, there was an emperor who made
Bruno Bucciarati and his crew are about to land on this island
Episodio 07 Six Bullets Appears, Part 1
Bucciarati, let's start to make a course toward land.
I've been looking for a while now, but there isn't a single boat following us.
No one should know that this boat is heading to Capri.
Yeah, there are no boats, but...
The problem is whoever that guy heard about the secret fortune from.
I have a hard time believing he followed us on his own.
You seem very interested in these, but they're not mine.
Which would you prefer me to use?
We need some answers from you.
If we don't get some, we'll be in danger.
You have a partner, don't you, Mr. Zucchero?
And they're also a Stand user, aren't they?
That's why I'll be using these.
You don't even want to bother telling me which one you'd like me to use?
If you won't pick one...
I'll just have to use both!
Well? Do you feel like talking now?
Ma-ri-o Zuc-che-ro. Heaven, Hell, or the 9th Circle of Hell...
Heaven, Hell, or...
The 9th Circle of Hell!
He's headed for the 9th Circle of Hell, according to this name divination!
If you're not going to tell us the name of
You should probably start worrying about your other eye, Mr. Zucchero!
Quit playing around, you dumbasses.
Damn it, come here and look at this.
Sounds like you found something with Moody Jazz's replay.
Let's have a look.
This whole boat was flat, but we'll be able to see him
Giorno!
I'll do you a favor and let you hear its voice, at least.
When I was watching the replay of him, he started using the boat's radio.
He's contacting someone.
I've already made four of them my hostages.
All that's left is Bucciarati and one other.
I'll have this taken care of in no time.
They were heading...
to Capri!
They haven't mentioned where the money's hidden, though.
Hey, what do we do about this?
After I get rid of his five friends, I'm gonna make Bucciarati cough it up. Over.
Was that yacht named ?
What's your current location?
We're about two hours out from Capri.
Bucciarati is wary of anyone following him, so he's taking a very roundabout route.
Got it.
Dock at Marina Grande. Over and out.
That's the end of the conversation. The radio cut off.
How could this be?
That means they're definitely already on the island!
Who is it? Who the hell was on the radio?
I'm going to make this guy tell us who it is, no matter what!
No, he's a hardcore gangster.
He probably won't say anything today.
Besides, he might not know what his partner's Stand looks like.
It's very possible his partner's kept it secret even from him.
Then what are we supposed to do?
What if we just come ashore like this?
If they find out we're the ones on this boat instead of Zucchero...
Also, if this boat doesn't arrive at Marina Grande in about an hour...
They guy on the radio is sure to think something happened to Zucchero.
If that happens, who knows if we'll be able to get the money?
I have my doubts we'd make it back to Naples in one piece!
What are we going to do, Bucciarati?
There's no time to hesitate.
We should at least outfox the guy.
I'll somehow get to the island first and—
all we need is someone to head to the island first and get rid of the guy.
What the hell are you talking about?
Are you sure you're not stupid?
Get to the island before this boat?
Yes.
Huh?!
I can change this ring buoy into a fish.
If I have it pull me, I'll be able to get to the island faster than this boat.
Of course, since it's my Stand, I'll be the one going.
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.
I want that ten billion lire.
We have to use that money to make Bucciarati a capo
and move our way up the ranks.
Giorno...
You're going to go? All right, fine.
But sadly, you don't know this guy's name or what he looks like.
Capri is filled with tourists.
How the hell are you going to find him?
I agree with Giorno's plan.
Even if we don't know who this guy is...
I think there's a high possibility that we can attack first
rather than wait for him to attack.
So how many people can that fish pull, Giorno?
My Stand, Six Bullets, is made for killing.
It's perfect for situations like this.
I'll be going, too.
Six Bullets
Guido Mista
It took us quite a while to swim from the yacht to the island.
We have 20 minutes before the time
That's about all the time we have left.
Giorno, how does the marina look?
Not good.
And they all look like they're waiting for someone.
They're probably just waiting for sightseeing vessels, but...
Mista, you have a plan to find the guy among that crowd of tourists
in the next 20 minutes, right?
What... are you doing?
It's way past lunchtime.
but he probably knows what I look like since I'm on Bucciarati's team.
That goes for you, too.
but listen, Mista.
Maybe even five.
He may get suspicious when the doesn't come into port
If that happens, we won't have a chance to find him.
We have to make our move imme—
And I told you, this is my lunchtime!
Lunchtime is for lunch!
Even boutiques and bookstores in this country honor lunchtime.
No one works if they don't have their lunch.
but these little guys pretty much expect it.
Lunchtime!
Give us food!
Here you go, guys. Lunch is served.
Tuscan salami is delicious!
Delicious!
This is the best!
Hey, gimme that!
Hey, come on now, Number 3!
Stop making Number 5 cry!
Stop fighting. There's enough for all of you.
I work so hard not to play favorites.
Number 5! Quit crying already!
What are they?
Hey, don't call them "things."
They get pissed off when they're treated like pets.
There's one for each bullet.
For each bullet?
This guy here keeps rushing us.
Could you guys take your nap after your work is done?
Hell no!
Hey, Number 3!
I keep telling you not to hit the others!
Mista!
I'll convince these guys to work.
You get the radio out of that plastic bag.
There'll be a feast after we do this job!
Let's do this, you guys!
Listen up. I'm going to sneak up to the security watchhouse
Is there anyone waiting for a yacht named ?
We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero on the !
Please come to the boat watchhouse!
Is there anyone waiting for a yacht named ?
We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero on the !
He might decide to be cautious and not answer the radio call...
Please come to the boat watchhouse!
Or he might get excited and run out, thinking the hiding place
Is there anyone waiting for the Lagoon?
but the one who comes to the boat watchhouse
We've received a transmission from a Mr. Zucchero!
Giorno, if anyone comes near the watchhouse, give me a signal.
If you're waiting for the Lagoon, please come to the boat watchhouse!
I'm gonna shoot the guy who takes the radio call!
But Bucciarati told me to not kill him, so I'll miss any vital points.
Or at least, I'll try.
No one's making a move yet...
No one's heading over there.
Is there no one?
No one's waiting for the ?
There's a transmission from Mr. Zucchero!
No, there's no one. Nothing.
He's supposed to be somewhere on this island.
Is he just being too cautious to answer the radio call?
Did something happen, Zucchero?
Why did you request an announcement?
What's going on?
No one's heading toward the watchhouse.
He's there! How?!
This isn't good. Does that watchhouse have a back entrance?
He's already inside the watchhouse!
It's too dark to see his face.
Mista hasn't realized he's in there!
At this rate, the guy's going to realize this is a trap and run!
I have to let Mista know!
What? The guy's coming to answer the radio call?
Which one is it?
Who's heading toward the watchhouse?
N-No!
He's not heading there!
He's already inside!
Don't come out!
He's by the window!
That guy is...
one of Bucciarati's guys!
Didn't Zucchero take care of him on the yacht?
Mista! Behind you!
He's on the radio! Mista!
Damn it! He can't hear me.
It's better than him not noticing!
He's already there!
Mista! He's already on the radio!
Come on! Pass, pass, pass!
Go, Six Bullets!
Menacing
Here we go!
Shoot!
Bazoo
Yay!
Heck yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
D-Did he get him?
Wh-Who the hell are you?!
Wh-What was that noise?
Gunshots.
Did it bother you?
But if it did bother you...
so I'll listen to your complaints later.
Guess Giorno just can't wait.
So there was a rear entrance...
Meaning he came through this door and got on the radio.
Either he was being cautious
Still...
Yay!
Leg!
Leg! Hey, hey!
We got his right leg!
We shot him right through his right leg!
Yeah, you sure did.
Now he won't get away!
There are a bunch of people outside...
And this side is basically a cliff.
There's no way he could climb up.
He must be scurrying about right now.
If he were to hide somewhere...
He must be in that truck.
If he's a Stand user, his Stand is probably close-range and extremely powerful.
If he was a remote-control type, he would've attacked me by now.
In that case, the guy who just got shot in the leg
trying to lure me as close to him as possible so that he can attack.
Well, it's not like he's going to get me, even if I get close to him.
He's probably just beyond there.
going over there alone isn't a safe plan at all.
I should wait for Giorno and—
Well, I guess that option's out.
He must've jump-started the engine.
It'll be bad news if this truck gets away right now.
Damn it! This isn't good!
I haven't seen his face yet!
Giorno probably hasn't, either!
I don't know what his Stand is yet, but I don't have a choice!
This is for the ten billion and Bucciarati!
Eat lead!
Mista!
Episodio 08 Six Bullets Appears, Part 2
All we need is someone to head to the island first and get rid of the guy.
It's perfect for situations like this.
I'll be going, too.
Mista! He's already on the radio!
Shoot!
Bazoo
Damn it! This isn't good!
It'll be bad news if this truck gets away right now.
Episode 08 Six Bullets Appears, Part 2
Guido Mista's way of life ever since
He loved to sleep and found joy in looking at branches
the scent of wine, and having a bite of cheese.
he would jump any jerk badmouthing movie stars
in front of the cinema and take their money.
but Mista lived a very happy life nonetheless.
but Mista always felt that
When Mista turned 17, he learned from a certain incident
that people have pre-determined destinies.
When they're young, people may find themselves
but they ultimately end up traveling the path they were destined to walk.
On a clear summer night, Mista was wandering around like he usually did.
Mista!
Hey, wanna go have some fun?
Sorry, we have plans.
Ciao!
Sure.
No! Let go of me!
Shut your mouth! There's no point in resisting!
Shut up! Quit your screaming!
The woman being punched in the parked car was half-naked.
She was bleeding from her nose and mouth, and about to lose consciousness.
For a moment, Mista hesitated to get involved, but...
Y-You bastard!
Because he's so simpleminded, his body acted on its own.
You bastard! What do you think you're doing to our bro?!
You little shit!
No matter how close you may be, there is no guarantee
you'll hit your target just because you pulled the trigger.
you end up pulling the trigger even if your gun isn't facing your target.
Both of the shots the hooligan fired
went under Mista's arm and disappeared into the darkness.
The hell?!
S-Stay back! You hear me?!
Three, four, five, six shots!
Unbelievably, they all faded into the darkness.
Then his panicked friends started shooting.
but not a single shot hit Mista.
Meanwhile, Mista was astonished at his own state of quiet concentration.
What the hell's going on?
Wh-Who is this guy?!
Bro!
Wh-What are you—
and pulled the trigger as calmly as a nurse inserting a shot
into a patient's arm.
He pointed the gun at their faces and shot four perfect shots.
but he didn't hesitate or feel any remorse.
In a helpless situation, Mista made the decision to cut through the shadows.
Eat lead!
because...
I wasn't planning to kill you, but...
O-Ow!
Damn it! You shot me twice, you piece of shit!
Quit moving! I'm going to aim properly this time, damn it!
How could I say something so lame?!
That's not what I meant!
I was supposed to ask how that bastard didn't die
after I shot him in the head!
Did the bullet just happen to miss his brain?
That was so charming of you, Mista.
Your name Mista, isn't it?
Isn't that right, Mista?
I can easily deflect a bullet from a puny little pistol.
but how many bullets was that in all, huh?
You fired four on this truck...
And I'm pretty sure you fired two back at the watchhouse in Marina Grande.
Right? I counted correctly, didn't I, Mista?
Now I can get close enough to beat the shit out of you safely, right?
Shit. I need to reload!
Wh-What the?!
Y-You're kidding me! My left hand won't let go!
Whoa!
Hey! How long are you gonna keep driving?! Stop the damn truck, you dumbass!
Yeah... Someone stop it, please.
Someone stop this truck! This thing is...
Think about it for a sec.
Did you think it was because I'm a nice guy?
Mista...
nor can he let go of the steering wheel.
I told you because you won't be able to reload
Those are the bullets that the bastard's Stand deflected.
They've stopped in mid-air, like they're fixed in place
Fixed in place...
and to affix the driver and me onto this truck.
His ability is to fix something he's touched into place.
The bullet I shot at him was also affixed to his skin at the opening of the wound
and hasn't actually penetrated his head. That's why he hasn't died!
I'm ecstatic that you attacked me.
So much that I'm willing to forget the fact that you shot a bullet at my head.
I mean, it was up in the air if Polpo's fortune actually existed or not.
It's just a rumor among some thugs, after all.
But the fact that you attacked me means it actually exists!
I'm overflowing with hope and motivation! All right!
I can passionately steal the ten billion from that bastard Bucciarati!
I told you it would be easy for my Stand to deflect your bullets!
Yee-haw!
Wh-What?! Another bullet showed up from the shadows?
He fired two bullets in a single shot?
Is that Mista's Stand?
But...
I can still deflect it somewhat!
Hell yeah!
Well done, Six Bullets Number 6 and Number 7!
there's nothing more to worry about!
Ow! You shot me again, you bastard!
But... you're not getting away.
This is for ten billion! You're not getting away!
There is a way to defeat him.
But he's strong... That's a fact.
Will I be able to do it?
Sale
Arts & Crafts
Blood...
A vehicle...
The enemy and Mista are in a car, heading toward the top of the island.
Will I be able to catch up with them?
Either way, I need to find a car to chase them in.
Four bullets?
What the hell's going on?
Why do I only have four left? Seriously!
Mista, it's because you dropped some bullets!
You dropped them, dummy!
Four is unlucky.
Don't put all four in there. It'll just be bad luck.
I-I can take my hands off the wheel!
Now I can finally stop!
Don't you dare stop!
Huh? B-But you told me to stop the truck earlier!
And what I'm saying right now is more correct, at least when I'm talking to you.
Listen up. I want to go back to Marina Grande.
My buddy's back at the marina.
I won't harm you. I'll even thank you if you take me back.
Got it?!
That bastard stops the bullets at the surface of his skin so they don't penetrate his body.
The ability to fix things in place...
If I can just shoot into his mouth...
He might actually die.
But I only have four bullets left.
Three would've been much better.
Now that I've seen his face and know who he is, I don't need to do anything dangerous.
It'd be much safer to meet back up with Giorno at the marina.
I have extra bullets with the rest of my things, too.
Th-That bastard!
Impossible! He scaled the cliff already?!
Hey, stop the truck!
Huh? Now what?
Stop the truck, I said!
Hurry it up!
Th-That's the guy from earlier!
Mista...
I'm not letting you get away, Mista!
He can affix rocks in the air, just like the bullets?
He climbed up here like he was using a ladder?
Why the hell did you stop the truck, you dumbass?!
Huh?
Drive!
Huh? Wait, what?
Full speed ahead! You'll be sorry if you stop!
If you want to settle things right here, right now...
Let's do this!
Driver, don't you dare stop the truck!
Just gotta tap it slightly with my finger...
it'll just keep building up force in the place where it's affixed.
I can't hit it too hard.
It'll throw off my aim, and my enemy will figure out which way it's going to fly.
And then... I let it loose!
Bam
What?!
It came back to you, Mista.
Those three Stands of yours that you just fired lost control and flew off.
Just a little at a time...
Just like tapping an SOS in Morse code.
but I can definitely use it on you right now!
Th-This really sucks...
Talk about bad luck.
Ever since I was a kid...
There are just some misfortunes you can't see.
Still, other than that, it's a good number.
I only have one bullet left, but this means the worst is over, right?
Now the number's one, damn it!
Number 5! Number 6! Group up!
We're all gonna group up on this last shot!
This is the the last of them, so give it your all!
Yeah!
Stay put, Mista!
or how many you fire, I clearly have the upper hand.
You've realized by now that it's impossible to beat me, haven't you, Mista?
If I told you...
that I only have one bullet left in this chamber, would you believe me?
I'm telling you the truth.
I'll be out of bullets.
You'll find out anyway, so I might as well tell you now.
If I miss this last shot, you'll see that I'm out of bullets!
Though messing up is hypothetical right now...
I'm definitely going to shoot you with this one, final bullet!
What are you pointlessly rambling on about, Mista?
It doesn't matter to me how many bullets you have left.
Whether you fire a single bullet or a hundred, you can't defeat me!
It's not pointless at all.
You're definitely going to let your guard down
This is pointless.
He's gonna use his Stand!
Leave it to me!
Let's go! We only have one target!
You're aiming for the inside of my mouth.
He opened his mouth on his own!
He's not going to defend himself!
We'll just have to charge right in!
I knew it.
Ow!
I knew you were aiming there...
At the inside of my mouth!
That's what any normal person would think...
That I shouldn't be able to use my ability to affix things inside my body.
It's a pain in the ass to guard myself, so I opened my mouth for you!
Impossible...
Damn... This really freakin' hurts!
But... it looks like you weren't lying about that being your last bullet.
I see you're not shooting again.
You done now, Mista?
If you're finished...
The launching power on this baby...
is more than ready, Mista!
I win! Take this! Release!
He really did let down his guard.
He let his guard down because Mista was out of bullets!
because the closer we get, the better we can aim!
Wh-What?!
Wh-When did they—
Shit! They're too close!
Here we go, boys!
Aim!
Arts & Crafts! Defend!
The bullet split in two?!
That's not good.
That's—
I aimed for the same wound.
it's going to push it just enough to dig further into your skull!
I mean, if you're invincible enough to withstand that too, I'm sorta screwed, but...
We did it!
Yes!
Yes!
Come on, Number 3.
He's still somewhat alive, even though he's got a bullet in his brain.
Guess your Stand really is invincible.
Bucciarati told me not to kill you, but...
Hey, we're going back! Back to the marina!
What do you want?!
Damn it.
Who the hell do they think I am?
How dare you threaten me?!
I'll let you off the hook for now, but next time I'm gonna let you have it!
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm chasing someone.
Could you take me to the top of the island in this truck?
Quit wasting time! I'm desperate here!
Y-Yes, sir...
Episodio 09 The First Mission from the Boss
Ow...
Yeah, you're going to have to go to the hospital.
I know that! I'm asking you to do something in the meantime!
Very well.
H-Hey, Fugo, you aren't—
Hey!
What the hell is this?!
Staples!
Narancia, could you wrap up his stomach with masking tape now?
Sure thing.
You sure this isn't going to get infected?
Don't worry about a thing.
Actually, you know, I kinda like it.
Would you pipe down?
Well done, you guys.
Thanks to you, we were able to get to Capri safely.
Zucchero, who attacked us on the boat, and the guy Mista handled
Then let's hurry up and go to the place where the ten billion lire is hidden!
Where did you hide it, Bucciarati?
A hidden safe at the bank?
Could you wait just a bit longer?
Why's that?
Why are you so worried about the time?
Shh!
Hey, you guys. We're still in here, so how 'bout it?
Can't you do the cleaning later?
Does your name happen to be Toilette?
Huh? What was that?
If your name is actually Toilette, that would mean this is your house.
You can boss around anyone you want in your own house.
But if that isn't the case, you've got no right to boss me around.
Huh? Hey, wait, dumbass!
Didn't you hear me? I said not to go in there!
Crack
Wh-What the hell do you think you're doing?!
You want a piece of me?!
What's going on?
A new enemy?
I'll kill you!
Wait!
Everyone, stop Narancia!
Why did you stop me?!
Could you be...
That voice...
All of you, bow.
This is Mr. Pericolo, one of the capos of Passione.
Bucciarati.
Episodio 09 The First Mission from the Boss
I contacted him as soon as we reached the island.
Mr. Pericolo came all this way to accept the money.
One of Passione's capos...
Thank you so much for coming all this way, sir.
No, no. I'm the one who said I wanted to come.
All of you, lift your heads.
You must be the newbie I heard about.
Yes, sir.
Bucciarati's told me all about you.
Now that you've joined Passione, you're basically family.
You're free to call me Mr. Pericolo.
Thank you, sir.
You, there. Sorry about earlier.
This one doesn't like being touched.
Sure.
You mean, "Yes, sir!"
There's a perfectly good reason for this. I'll tell you later.
More importantly, you do have it, don't you?
The ten billion lire to hand over to the organization.
Yes, sir. Right here.
What? What did you just say?!
He said it's right here!
Here?!
Bucciarati, where is it?
All I see are urinals...
Plop
I-It was inside the urinal?!
I mean, that's as safe as it gets, but...
Yup... It's real.
This necklace alone is worth at least seven or eight hundred million.
I won't bother asking how you got this fortune.
All the organization cares about is that you have the money.
Wait, you're already putting it away?
C-Could I just touch it a little?
The reality this fortune shows us is that the owner is intelligent and trustworthy.
Congratulations, Bucciarati.
H-Hell, yeah! He's a capo!
Bucciarati's finally a capo!
You'll be taking over Polpo's turf, now that he's dead.
Fifty percent of the profit will go to the organization, and the other fifty will be yours.
That's amazing!
With Bucciarati's brains and popularity, he'll be rolling in the cash in no time!
But the ball suddenly started rolling as soon as this newbie Giorno joined.
Is he some kind of lucky boy or something?
but he had left one job unfinished.
Of course, you'll be taking on any jobs that Polpo had, Bucciarati.
Are you okay with that?
A job that Polpo left unfinished?
It's a direct order from the boss.
The... boss?
The boss...
The boss no one's ever met?
An order... directly from him?
Correct. I'll tell you right here and now.
You'll be guarding the boss's daughter, and risking your lives doing so.
That's all.
Daughter?
The boss...
Did you say "daughter"? The boss has a daughter?
You'll start guarding her right now. I've handed her over to you.
Handed her over?
Bucciarati!
Could that guy be...
No, not "guy."
She must be the boss's daughter!
That's her?
Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?
That's fine, Trish.
For now, stay by her side.
The order is already in effect.
Bucciarati.
Her name is Trish Una, and she's fifteen years old.
"Una" is her mother's maiden name, not the boss's family name.
Trish hasn't met the boss once in her life.
Bucciarati, as you're well aware, no one knows who the boss is.
But of course, even the boss has a past, especially when he was young.
Two months ago, a woman named Donatella died of illness in Calabria.
A few days before her death, she asked that a man named Solido Naso be found.
That man was Trish's father.
but...
Naso doesn't exist.
Correct?
Beware of anyone trying to look into the name Naso.
Anyone with any status in Passione is very cautious about that.
Just trying to look into the boss's past would mean
Word about Donatella eventually spread.
Of course, the boss caught wind of this, as well.
The boss's decision was immediate.
Through a few other men, he gave me the order
The boss must've known immediately.
we found out that someone was after her life.
murdered.
Who is it? Who's after her?
People who have betrayed the organization.
We don't know how many of them there are.
They're trying to defeat the boss and take over his drug trafficking routes.
Drugs...
They're under the impression that Trish knows a secret about the boss.
They want information so that they can defeat the boss.
But Trish is just a frail little girl who knows nothing.
How long will we be guarding her?
One week... Actually, it could even be less.
It's just until the boss finds those traitors and gets rid of them.
Leave this island immediately and hide her somewhere.
The only ones who know that Trish is with you are the boss and myself.
Mr. Pericolo.
You said that order was supposed to go to Polpo, correct?
Which means...
The enemies are Stand users...
I'd say that's a safe assumption.
They're most likely moving as a team, as well.
We don't yet know how many there are.
I don't have a Stand ability.
I'll contact you again if I learn anything else.
Um...
M-Me?
Yes. Is it with you... um...
Yes, that's correct.
But it'll be all six of us.
We will be risking our lives to protect you.
I see.
My jacket? Why?
Just hurry up and take it off.
It's not as if I want to see you shirtless or anything.
V-Very well.
I don't have a handkerchief, so go buy one for me.
Also, some stockings and Givenchy Blush No. 2.
The stockings need to be reinforced at the thighs.
and some mineral water.
I'd rather die than drink one that's not from France, though.
When you're done gawking at the scenery, go buy that stuff for me.
Guard the boss's daughter, huh?
So we suddenly have a connection to the mysterious boss that I've been looking for.
This is definitely worth doing.
But if we fail, it'll mean our lives.
All six of us are well aware of that fact.
What's your problem? Calm down.
I'm just trying to pet you.
At 9:25 this morning at Naples Prison, Polpo shot himself in the head.
Hey, come on.
Quit struggling! I can't read it. Jeez...
"At 9:25 this morning at Naples Prison, Polpo shot himself in the head."
Well, damn... I was sure it'd be Polpo.
Who is it, then?
Who's the one guarding Trish, who disappeared?
Find them
Find them
Well, then...
"Find them," eh?
But was anyone as reliable as Polpo?
Only a capo would be tasked with such an important job.
And someone with Stand abilities.
Did anyone else like that exist?

Mysterious Boss (Villain)
We're going to defeat the boss and make a killing from his drugs.
Find them and get rid of them.
Protect my daughter!
Daughter(Trish)
15 yrs
The boss's daughter must know something about him.
We're taking her hostage regardless
We were ordered to guard her. Orders are absolute. We'll guard her with our lives.
We're also bad, but we believe it's morally wrong to profit from drugs. (We'll find out your true identity one day)
Team of Traitors (Villains)
We don't know how many there are, but they're definitely Stand users
Polpo's death brings chaos to the organization (The bow and arrow no longer exist)
And that's it for shopping.
Surroundings are all clear.
Let's see...
and then head in the opposite direction.
Okay!
Narancia, listen carefully.
That's a list of food and other things you need to buy.
These are the keys to the car.
You can do this, Narancia.
I know you can pull it off.
Okay.
not even the people at the winery in the vineyard out front.
Once you're done shopping, try going in circles on the same path over and over again.
Also try U-turning every once in a while.
Check to see if anyone's following you.
Then, come home after switching over to the other car
but if someone's looking for us, the last thing we want them to do is follow us.
Do you understand?
But we have to make absolutely sure no one finds out about this hideo—
Jeez, I get it already!
Leave it to me!
Okay, now repeat all the steps I just explained to you from the beginning.
Huh?
Jb
Ow!
Wrong! Quit messing around! Again, from the beginning!
Huh?
Um...
Drive around so I don't get dizzy—
Jb
Urgh! What the hell is your problem?!
Come on, Abbacchio!
I'm older than him, damn it!
Letting him go shopping is a mistake!
You two will have to figure out whether or not you should be jabbed on your own.
But with Narancia's Stand ability, he should be able to stop anyone tailing him.
So basically, that means I just need to make sure I'm not followed back here, right?
By anyone who might follow me!
Something's wrong.
but something feels off.
I've got a bad feeling about switching over to the other car that Fugo prepared, too.
Huh?
Come on already.
Where exactly are you headed, huh, Narancia?
That came from below!
Hey, so, where are you headed?
You keep looking behind you.
Who the hell are you?! Get outta the car!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, talk about scary!
I'm the one asking the questions here.
Don't answer a question with another question. That's rude.
Shut up! Get the hell out of my car, you dumbass!
You're not leaving me with any choice.
My name's Formaggio.
I'm a member of the organization.
You already know that Polpo died yesterday, right?
Yet everyone on your team just happened to disappear at once.
Shit... He's bad news.
He shouldn't know the truth, but he's definitely after us.
Right when I had something important to discuss with you guys...
I-Is he a Stand user?
Narancia, I finally managed to find you, but why are they gone?
Where's Bucciarati and the rest of your squad?
Who knows?
Did you check the restaurants around here?
This car...
It's a rental, isn't it?
Bucciarati was the one who rented it.
If you didn't know that, why the hell are you in this car?
Well?
I-I always drive around in Bucciarati's cars.
I'm seventeen, so I don't have my own car yet.
That's why I'm borrowing his.
Oh, yeah. Did you hear?
Apparently the mortician is trying to figure out how the hell to cremate Polpo's corpse.
They can't figure out how to get his body into the furnace.
They're just gonna have to chop him up into tiny pieces, aren't they?!
Shut up!
Hey, you think so, too, right?
Huh?
What the hell? Th-There's no one here!
You actually fell for it.
Man, you're useless.
Say, Narancia, why are you guys
hiding somewhere when a capo's funeral is going on?
I'm gonna make you talk if I can't just follow you!
Now you've done it, you asshole!
You're gonna tell me all kinds of things, right here and now!
You bastard...
Huh?
You bastard...
I'll murder you!
What the hell is that?!
Li'l Bomber!
So he's a Stand user... Tiny Feet!
Bada
Shit!
Look at how badly I'm bleeding!
How dare you?! How dare you?! How dare you?!
Bada Bada Bada
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
This is definitely not good...
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Th-This little shit!
I'll kill you!
Sh-Shit! He's out of his goddamn mind...
He's lost it and is shooting anything in sight!
And I'm stuck in this narrow car with nowhere to run!
That's the most dangerous part of all this!
A-A bomb?!
Murder him, Li'l Bomber!
How do you like that? And that?! And that?! And that?!
Are you dead yet?
Ow! Damn it!
Did we do it?
H-He's gone!
Did the blast blow him away?
But... there's not even a shred of his corpse left!
Wh-Where did he go?!
Oh, come on... I'm right here.
I can make myself small.
Tiny Feet... All the other guys say this ability is worthless.
What determines if something is worthless or not is how you use your brain.
That's how it is with abilities.
What the hell? I don't see him anywhere!
How the hell?! Damn it, where did he go?
Is he here?
The same thing happened when he first showed up in the car!
Well, good luck in your search.
Where the hell did he just pop up from?
I'm gonna be buying some time here.
Now he's hiding somewhere!
A woman...
This bastard's bought stuff for a woman.
Stockings and blush... And it's high-end blush to boot!
Who's he shopping for?
Is it for his mom or his older sister?
so they buy fashion and makeup stuff on their own.
The only chick who'd have a guy buy stuff like this...
is a chick who can't leave her place for some reason!
This is becoming more and more suspicious.
Looks like my gut feeling was right!
the one who was ordered to guard the boss's daughter is Bucciarati!
In that case, I'll make sure I get Narancia to show me where they're hiding.
My ability should start working on him at any moment now...
Damn it... That bastard's definitely somewhere around here...
I'm sure he plans to follow me all the way back.
But...
I'm gonna find him and kill him!
I just have to make it back without getting followed.
I'm going to follow the orders I was given!
Episodio 10 Hitman Team
You're not leaving me with any choice.
My name's Formaggio.
How do you like that? And that?! And that?! And that?!
I'm sure he plans to follow me all the way back.
But...
I just have to make it back without getting followed.
I'm going to follow the orders I was given!
Did you hear that loud noise?
I wonder what that was.
Come back for now, Li'l Bomber!
That bastard is somewhere nearby, but I should get away from here.
With all these people gathering, it'd be a bad idea to attack with my Stand.
Huh? The bleeding's stopped already.
Huh?
Where'd this knife come from?
My knife's not this big.
These shoes aren't mine, either! They're way too big!
Where the hell did my shoes go?
There's something
A-And this steering wheel.
I-I can't reach!
My foot won't reach the pedals, and this seat is huge!
I can't see through the windshield!
What the hell?! This car isn't mine, either!
Where'd it go? Where'd the car I came here in go?!
I can't get back without it! Damn it!
Is he actually that stupid?
Get a damn clue! You're shrinking!
The effects of the wound I gave you are finally starting to show!
W-Wait, these my shoes and knife.
Did you finally figure it out, you moron?
But it's too late now.
S-So this is that stalker guy's Stand ability?
You're gonna tell me where the boss's daughter is.
The battle's already begun.
Episodio 10 Hitman Team
Hey, did you guys get my mineral water yet?
I'm thirsty.
I'm about to die from thirst.
I'd actually like to have lunch soon myself.
I mean, I'm fine, but I need to feed these little guys.
Feed us!
Narancia is indeed taking a while.
This is why I was worried about him going.
Drop it, Fugo. How many times must you bring this up?
I'm not going to drop it! After I—
I-I apologize.
Anything cut by my Tiny Feet becomes small.
It does take a little while for the ability to go into effect, though.
The clothes and bandana you have on now are shrinking with you.
which means that the more you shrink, the fewer things you'll be able to use.
O-Oh, yeah! I need to get a hold of Bucciarati and the others!
Ow! What the hell's with that automated door?!
I'm still shrinking?
This door...
I've become so light that it won't open!
Exactly, you moron.
Still...
I have to get to that phone as soon as possible so they can help me!
It opened, damn it!
It's useless!
It looks like you haven't realized this, but your clothes and wallet are shrinking with you.
You need a telephone card or coins to use the pay phone!
It only takes coins that are the right size!
Narancia's Height: 62.5cm
This guy might be smarter than I thought...
This isn't good.
That definitely can't happen!
I'm not gonna let that happen!
H-He's here! That bastard's gotta be around here somewhere!
Where are you? Are you hiding under the phone?
Come out here, damn it!
This is perfect.
Are you over here?
In a few more minutes, he'll shrink down to the size of a cockroach.
Where are you?!
Narancia's Height: 58.0cm
and then I'll be able to torture the shit out of him.
Then I'll win!
I guess I don't have a choice.
He shouldn't be able to find me, but I just have to wait a little longer...
I finally figured it out, you bastard!
You're in my right ass pocket!
Now I've got you! The ability to become smaller?
Were you in my pocket this whole time?
Damn it. But you sure are tiny...
Wait... How did he figure out I was in his pocket?!
Shoot him dead, Li'l Bomber!
T-Turn back!
Wha—
A b-ballpoint pen?!
Narancia's Height: 53.0cm
Damn it! Where'd you go?!
What the hell did you do?!
That stalker bastard! Where are you?!
That was a close one.
The repulsion it created in that moment
But how'd he figure out that I was in his pocket?
Did I move around too much and tickle his ass?
I-Impossible!
I hid immediately! How'd it find me?!
There you are! You're not getting away, you stalker bastard!
It's coming after me!
Th-This is bad! Tiny Feet!
Wh-Where'd that bastard go?!
That was way too close.
If the air pressure from the tire hadn't sent me flying, I would've been done for!
But I'm sure it won't find me down—
Y-You can't be serious! Shit!
This Stand's ability isn't just shooting endlessly!
It's somehow finding me, and it's definitely following me!
And it's not like it's seeing or hearing my movements.
That wouldn't explain how it figured out I was in his pocket
I found you! You're down in that drain!
I-It can even find me underwater?!
Tiny Feet!
D-Damn it! Think, think, think, think, think!
I can't die here!
The Hitman Team has nine members.
Formaggio is one of them.
2 years ago / Naples
I'm planning to address the trash problem at next week's assembly.
Are you sure it'll be okay?
Don't worry. I'm just going to tell the Minister of Tourism the right answer.
It's the same thing as usual.
I always worry that you might be pushing yourself too hard.
Dear, don't you think you're drinking too much today?
What the hell, Pesci?
B-But my stomach sorta turns when I drink espresso.
That's why you're such a mammoni, Pesci!
Just by drinking that milk, it's possible you're making us lamer by association.
Why do you think we even bring you along, anyway?
You need to correct things like that first.
O-Okay...
So, Formaggio, how are things going?
That's all yours, Pesci. A little gift from me to you.
Looks like things went well.
Yeah, the job's basically done.
Now we just have to watch it happen.
Let's get this over with and watch a soccer match.
Narancia Ghirga
Li'l Bomber
It was delicious.
Thank you very much.
We'll be waiting for your return.
All right, let's finish things off.
That was wonderful.
I'm glad I went with the white tod—
What's the matter, dear? Are you in pain?
Hey! What the hell are you doing parking here?!
W-Wait, what's that coming out from underneath the car?
Th-Th-That's blood!
All right, let's go home.
What's the matter, Pesci? Did your knees give out?
We're back!
How'd it go?
Perfectly!
The guy's been blown to bits.
But you ended up killing the chick he was with in the process, too.
I guess this job was perfect for your useless Stand ability.
Whatever, man. If you got a problem, take care of this yourself.
As much as I'd love to, the leader wants me to conserve
Melone, how much was this job?
my ability until we absolutely need to use it.
Twenty million lire.
Damn, that's cheap!
Ghiaccio, calm down. We'll talk about money later.
More importantly...
Are they playing hooky?
Maybe they're getting it on somewhere.
And you call my Stand ability useless?
No, something's definitely wrong.
Gelato's one thing, but Sorbet would never miss out on a chance to get rich.
He's always made sure to show up to claim his share.
there will always be people within that group who want to rebel.
When smuggling cheap drugs coming from Central Asia
Which means it's not the least bit strange
Did you find them?
No, there's no sign of them.
They must've been dealt with because they were
It's definitely possible.
But the only thing that we, the Hitman Team, get is our pay from the boss!
This ain't fair!
We deserve way better!
He suffocated?
Yeah... Just Gelato, though.
"Punishment"
Punishment...
A few days later, a bunch of packages with no sender were delivered to the team.
Seriously? Again?
Who the hell's the sender?!
Frames?
Is this what they call modern art or some shit?
There's something weird in them.
Hey!
Th-That's the same color nail polish that Sorbet always wears!
I-I've seen it before...
Get the frames out and line them up.
There were a total of 36 of these art pieces.
Oh, hell no...
You can't be serious... This is...
I don't want to see any more!
Shut up!
That's...
They were pieces of Sorbet's body, chopped up and preserved in formalin.
When they put his face together, they saw that it was distorted in fear.
He was likely cut into pieces by a very sharp knife, starting with his toes.
It was a rather intense way of getting killed.
That day, the Hitman Team came to a new understanding.
D-Do you think that Sorbet
was sliced up right in front of Gelato?
Yeah. And he was so overcome with fear and despair
that he choked on his own gag and suffocated!
This was a silent message from the boss.
All of you...
Forget all about Sorbet and Gelato.
From then on, they ended up getting the cold shoulder.
They never tried to find out the boss's identity ever again.
At least, not until...
they found out that the boss had a daughter.
Damn it! I'm not going to die in a place like this!
We're gonna kill the boss and take over his drug route!
We're gonna claw our way up from this hellhole!
It's riddled with holes?
He shot that rat to death? Why?
C-Could it be...
It went the other way.
Breathing?! So that's it!
Narancia's Stand, Li'l Bomber, detects its target when they breathe!
Mosquitoes find animals to suck blood from by searching for
This is the same thing!
he stopped searching for me.
There was a chance he would've shot one of those randos!
It had detected my breathing!
There you are!
He shot again!
Looks like he can't tell the difference between me and the rats.
In that case...
Look at those creepy little shits...
Th-These numbers... and this movement pattern...
The ones that are breathing must be rats!
Their speed is the same!
A threat... You were only a threat when I didn't know how you worked.
How were you finding me?
Narancia!
I win, Narancia!
I'm gonna get the hell outta here and wait for you to shrink into nothing!
H-How?
The same movement...
but there's only one rat who's breathing really hard...
Are you tired? You're out of breath.
I think it might be worth it to shoot the shit out of that fatty there!
Shit!
Yes! A clean shot!
Th-That was close...
If I hadn't returned to my normal size, I would've been done for!
If time hadn't passed to the point of you becoming so small
Narancia's Height: 13.2cm
that your Stand power was rendered useless...
I would've been a goner!
I-I didn't get him!
Did I become so small that Li'l Bomber's power also shrank?
My attacks won't work anymore!
Episodio 11 Narancia's Li'l Bomber
I think it might be worth it to shoot the shit out of that fatty there!
Yes!
Th-That was close...
If I hadn't returned to my normal size, I would've been done for!
If time hadn't passed to the point of you becoming so small
that your Stand power was rendered useless...
I would've been a goner!
I-I didn't get him!
That bastard's on the move!
Come back, Li'l Bomber!
but I need to hide somewhere.
The dude's desperate.
I-It's so far!
The sidewalk's so damn wide!
Move! You're in my way, damn it!
Damn it...
Now I've got you.
Well, shit...
You've caused me so much trouble.
Now, you're going to tell me
where Bucciarati and his guys are hiding the boss's daughter.
K-Kill me!
Damn it, just kill me already!
Do you really think I want to live so badly
that I'd tell you where my friends are? Huh?!
Narancia Ghirga was born in 1984 and is a Leo.
When he was ten...
N-Narancia...
I'm right here, Mom.
Mom...
Hey, Dad...
You shithead...
That was the beginning of the path that led Narancia to where he is now.
Episodio 11 Narancia's Li'l Bomber
Hey, I need to ask for directions.
How many minutes would it take to walk to this place?
Narancia rebelled against his father.
Minutes? That'd take you hours.
and get by daily by eating the food he had stolen that day.
It all went as planned!
It's all because you told us about that shop, Bro.
You sure you don't need to go to school?
You actually come from a decent home.
Like I give a shit about that home.
The most important thing in this world is friendship!
Yeah.
You should dye your hair blonde like mine.
Yeah!
What? Seriously?
What do you think?
You look so dumb!
Hey, where's Bro?
Who knows? I haven't seen him in a few days.
Huh...
But the next day...
You bastards!
Put both hands on the wall!
You little shit! You're going to juvenile hall!
What the hell are you talking about?! Me, a robber?!
Of course I'm no—
Quit lyin'! We have a witness!
Wha—
That's him! That blonde brat is the suspect!
N-No, I'm not!
I'm sure of it! He beat me up and took my money!
Quit lyin', you old hag! I didn't do anything!
Just admit to your crimes, you little shit!
Hey! That's going too far!
You saw him, Counselor.
A robber...
Don't tell me...
No, that's not possible!
Stop thinking up shit like that, damn it!
A year later, when Narancia left juvenile hall, his eye was afflicted.
When he returned to town, strange rumors were going around.
Look at that.
How do they know that?
Wow, they already let you out?
I don't want to get infected.
Stay the hell away from me.
It couldn't be... But Bro is...
He felt trapped, so he used me as a scapegoat...
The one most afraid of these rumors concerning the eye disease
was Narancia himself.
This is fate...
Soon... just like Mom...
I'm going to die from this eye disease!
That's what he believed. He had nowhere to go.
He was all alone.
Narancia had given up on life at the age of fifteen.
How awful. He's just a child.
It's a pity, but we shouldn't get involved.
I'd like to feed him some spaghetti!
You don't mind, do you?
nor did he give him a look of disgust.
He just set the plate of spaghetti he'd ordered for himself
in front of the filthy child.
He then had the kid receive the treatment he needed.
Three weeks later...
Why are you doing all this for me?
There's no reason.
If you want, you can stay at my house.
But kids like you should go back home to their parents.
Also, go to school. Got it?
U-Um, are you in a gang?
I don't want to go back home.
Please let me work for you!
Don't be so naïve, you little shit!
If you say that again, I'll punch you!
As instructed, Narancia went back home and even started going back to school.
But he could never trust his father again.
Why did he get so serious about scolding me?
There's nothing special about me.
But...
It was totally different from when my dad or those cops got mad at me.
When I think about how he acted, I feel confident.
Real men...
should work for guys like him!
Six months later, Narancia went to see
and he passed the test.
now is probably the best time to do it.
The girl you're trying to kidnap doesn't belong to a gang or anything like that!
She's just an ordinary girl!
Bucciarati hates shit like that, even if it's an order!
No decent person would like that!
so we're going to protect her, no matter what!
Would you quit with your worthless drivel?
Well, shit...
All this crap about your friends and protecting this chick...
That's not what we're talking about here.
Y-You bastard!
Hundreds of billions!
That's an amount worth a few people dying over!
It's going to be ours! There's no turning back now!
Since she's the boss's daughter, she's bound to have a Stand ability!
The boss doesn't want people finding that out!
We'll definitely be able to figure out who the boss is through his daughter's ability!
What? That girl's a Stand user?
Did you know...
Apparently its venom can even kill humans.
This spider isn't deadly.
But...
Even a normal spider's bite is venomous.
Y-You aren't gonna...
More than venomous enough to paralyze tiny little insects and eat them!
Li'l Bomber!
Whoa, there!
I told you, your Stand is powerless now!
This bottle is gonna be the ring, Narancia!
Y-You bastard! Hey!
It's looking at you! It's looking right at you!
It's watching you carefully with all eight of its eyes!
Open up! Open the bottle!
Damn it!
Listen carefully. Even if it bites you, you won't die instantly.
First, its venom will paralyze your body, so you'll no longer be able to move.
But once you can't move and it traps you, you're in real danger.
Then it'll start injecting you with even more venom and digestive juices.
Those digestive juices will slowly melt your insides to the consistency of a milkshake
so it can suck you right up.
And you're going to be conscious the whole time.
If you finally feel like talking, you can still talk while you're being eaten.
But you're probably better off telling me right now
where the boss's daughter is.
I really don't want to see a person end up melted and eaten by a spider.
I-It's fast!
You bastard!
A shard of glass?!
He somehow got it and kept it on him?!
W-Webbing?
When did...
It bit him!
You can't move anymore because your muscles are spasming.
Just hurry up and tell me.
This is your last chance if you don't wanna die.
Damn it... Like hell I'm gonna tell you!
Damn it!
Looks like it's injecting its digestive juices into you now.
It's gonna melt you...
Huh?
What's that?
You dropped this when you took that shard
Maybe... I don't need you to tell me anymore.
This is a map of this city.
It's a driving map. Not only that...
so you wouldn't get lost!
How stupid are you?!
If I follow these directions in reverse, I can see where you came from!
A vineyard!
Grazie, Narancia!
you moron!
Tiny Feet
Formaggio
Twenty kilometers southeast!
The boss's daughter Trish is somewhere in that area!
I did it! You don't have to talk anymore!
My Li'l Bomber has the ability to detect and pursue carbon dioxide.
But carbon dioxide doesn't just come from living creatures.
It's also produced by burning things.
I just remembered...
I also shot at the car.
I'm pretty sure I shot the gasoline tank...
But I can't really tell where the hole is from here.
So I shot at it.
See, it wasn't the spider I was shooting at earlier.
What?!
Damn it!
All the shopping bags got burned to a crisp!
Narancia's Height: 5.5cm -> 170.5cm (His normal height)
But it feels great to be back at a size where a spider bite won't matter.
How dare you?!
I'm gonna murder all of your friends!
Hideout... Blergh!
Vineyard... Blah!
Just you wait, Narancia!
Tiny Feet!
Wh-What?!
He put out the fire with the blood that squirted out of his wrist?!
Damn it! This isn't good!
Letting him get away now is not good at all!
I have to find him using Li'l Bomber's ability!
Sh-Shit!
These flames...
Y-You bastard! Where are you?!
Is this lucky or unlucky?
you can't track me because of all the carbon dioxide coming from the flames!
I guess if this comes down to winning or losing, I've won!
You're not getting away!
I know where the boss's daughter is.
Now I just need to get out of here and let my buddies know.
We'll murder you all!
Assassinations are our specialty!
Assassinations?
I'll make sure I pay you back for this soon!
I win!
Boooooom
If I can't track your breathing...
If the flames are too big...
I'll just make them bigger!
You're not getting away, Formaggio!
Are you mad, you bastard?
You actually set the whole street on fire!
Are you sane? You bastard!
Huh?!
I guess I don't need to set the whole city on fire now.
what you basically did was tell me that you want me to kill you as soon as possible.
Thanks to the flames, I was able to get this close to you.
Did you forget?
At this distance, my Stand is faster than yours!
It might be.
Bring it, Narancia...
Tiny Feet!
Well, shit...
was it, Narancia?
Now things are going to get more difficult...
for you bastards!
"Go shopping," they tell me...
Mission... incomplete.
Both the money and the stuff I bought...
went up in flames...
Narancia, repeat it one more time.
I told you, the shopping—
Not that!
But I took care of him right after—
That's not the issue here!
Bucciarati, we should get the hell out of here.
After I warned you so many times...
You fool!
I think Narancia did a great job stopping the enemy.
I think he did everything he should've done.
he should give us a method of escape.
I don't think we should leave until we hear from the boss.
Well, aren't you clever?
Do you think you're an advisor now?
And how do you know that the boss will contact us soon?
No one cares about your damn hunches!
Bucciarati!
I think we got a message from the boss!
Message for Bucciarati
This is how the boss always sends his orders to the capos.
This is the first time Bucciarati's received one!
I'll check out the message.
"Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park. I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."
Look into that immediately!
"That key is for a vehicle that'll bring my daughter safely to me."
Vehicle? What does he mean by a safe vehicle?
A helicopter!
That must be a key to a helicopter!
We can go anywhere in a helicopter without anyone following us!
It's a bit less than fifteen kilometers from here to Pompeii.
An hour should be plenty of time to get over there and get the key.
Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!
You three head to Pompeii and get that key!
Mista, Narancia, and I will remain here and protect Trish from the Hitman Team.
Retrieve the key, and if it seems safe, contact us.
Then we'll take Trish and head to over to that vehicle.
I'm counting on you.
Episodio 12 The Second Mission from the Boss
"Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park. I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."
"That key is for a vehicle that'll bring my daughter safely to me."
Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!
You three head to Pompeii and get that key!
Episodio 12 The Second Mission from the Boss
The city of Pompeii was known to the Romans as a peaceful, prosperous health resort.
It was then abruptly destroyed by the lapilli and lava
on August 24th, 79 AD.
wine bottles, and even carriage tracks left behind
The dog mosaic we're looking for
is located near the entrance of the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii.
you were supposed to turn right at that corner, not left.
You should've told me sooner, Giorno.
What point is there if you tell me that after I turn?
You're exactly right.
I apologize. I'll be more careful next time.
That's not the point here, damn it!
Hey, Fugo.
We're in a hurry, so don't lose it now.
I know that!
Damn it...
Well, Fugo's always like this.
I'm more concerned about this newbie, Giorno Giovanna.
but there's just something I don't like about him.
This guy's going to do something...
Something that might get us killed.
Pompeii, huh?
I haven't been here since I visited on a field trip as a kid.
Abbacchio, Giorno, let's hurry.
The place we're looking for is about 100 meters ahead.
It should take us about thirty minutes to get what we need
Abbacchio, Giorno, be on your guard.
To think we'd be found so soon...
How many are there?
One... for now.
He's peeking around that stone pillar behind us.
Pillar? Which one would that be?
Wake up, Giorno.
There's only one pillar.
Can't you see it?
but I don't see anyone, either.
Quit messing around! He's heading right toward us!
Fugo?
There! The guy walking over here!
H-He was right there...
A guy came out from behind that pillar!
I saw him in this mirror!
Wh-What?!
There! He's right there! He's coming out!
H-He's inside the mirror?
He's revealed his Stand! Who's going to fight him?!
Hold on, Fugo. I have no idea what you're talking about.
Is something wrong with the mirror?
This isn't good! He's going to attack!
Get away from the mirror!
What?
Giorno! Abbacchio!
Wh-Where are you, Giorno? Abbacchio?
Where did you go?!
The guy who was in the mirror is gone, too.
What did he do?
It was bizarre to have a mirror hanging in a place like this to begin with!
What in the world is this ability?
I don't...
I don't know what it is...
But there's something off about this scenery.
I'm right here.
What?!
Pannacotta Fugo...
Highly intelligent, with an IQ of 152, and entered university at the age of thirteen.
But he went berserk on a professor there
From then on, he spiraled down to where he is now.
The ones who accompanied him are the former cop Leone Abbacchio and...
No documents on the other guy. He must be new.
I think I heard you call him Giorno.
What did you do to them?
Y-You bastard...
Where did you hide them?!
My watch is backwards?
Also, I was wearing it on my left wrist, but now it's on my right?
D-Don't tell me this place is...
Your ability is—
I guess you're pretty quick on the uptake.
One at a time, Fugo...
but we'll start with you, since you were the first to look at the mirror.
I-It wasn't Abbacchio and Giorno that disappeared...
W-We're inside the mirror!
It was me!
Fugo!
Hey, Giorno!
Didn't you see anything?!
I'm not sure.
Fugo! Where did you go?!
Before he disappeared, Fugo yelled at us to get away from the mirror.
And he asked whether we could see the man walking from behind the the pillar.
This mirror...
Is there something... about this mirror?
The question is...
That's the most important question...
But I'm pretty sure I also need to know why
I figure you're here to look for something...
If you turn just up the way, it'll lead you to the famous dog mosaic.
Is there something there?
I'll be taking it!
I refuse!
Then die!
No...
You'll be the one dying when you witness my ability!
Purple Smoke!
My Stand won't appear?
I see... So your Stand is named Purple Smoke.
Something's wrong. My Stand did come out.
I can feel it... So why?
Hey, Giorno...
Slowly walk toward me.
Slowly what?
Just come over here, you dumbass!
Forget the "slowly" part! Just get over here!
What?! Th-That's—
Giorno! Forget about that!
That's not our enemy! That's Fugo's Stand!
Just hurry up and get away from it!
Fugo's—
Get away from Purple Smoke!
Hurry up!
Your current location is inside the mirror.
I'm sure you can figure out exactly why I dragged you in here alone.
I control the inside of the mirror... That's my ability.
All the things in here are objects that have no life.
You and I are the only living beings here.
That's because I didn't allow anyone else.
I only allowed you, and you alone, to come in.
Which means... your Stand ability was left outside!
This is my Mirror Man!
Purple Smoke has appeared outside the mirror.
Then there should be some way to fight!
Mirror Man
Illuso
Pannacotta Fugo was born into a wealthy family
It appeared as though he lived the perfect life.
But the weight of the expectations that his parents and others
but he would do everything he could to control them and get by.
that rage went out of control in the worst possible way.
Fugo.
Professor.
What are you doing here so late?
I'm working on the assignment due next week. I couldn't find the right judicial precedent...
Oh, come on.
No, I shouldn't keep bothering you...
My job is to teach and lead young people like you in the right direction.
How about it?
Please excuse me.
Now, wait just a moment.
I wouldn't mind telling you what's going to be on the next test...
It'll be fine. Just relax, now.
Stop... Stop...
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!
I'll be gentle.
I told you to stop, damn it!
I looked up to you!
You piece of shit!
Did you hear?
Are you sure he wasn't the one to lead him on?
That's probably how he got into this school, too.
but they then treated him like filth and disowned him.
All alone, Fugo started shoplifting and picking pockets to survive.
Ironically, this lifestyle actually let him use his intellect to its full potential.
You little bastard! How dare you try to dine and dash?!
I'm gonna make sure they throw you in jail!
No, that won't be possible.
Are you familiar with the De Sica vs. Argento case from 1982?
Mr. Bucciarati! Please say something to this brat!
Well, that sounds interesting.
That was right around the time Bucciarati was thinking about creating his own team.
That basically sums up my life story.
Please don't pity me.
I see. But, well... I think our meeting is fate.
Would you like to join my team, Pannacotta Fugo?
I want your intellect and knowledge.
Mr. Bucciarati, was it?
Joining a gang doesn't sound so bad, but I've already made up my mind.
I'm going to live on my own, not bothering with anyone else.
Oh? And why is that?
I told you.
When I lose my temper, I do horrifying things.
If I were to join your team, I might even end up killing you.
In that case, let's see if that'll actually happen.
Come with me, Fugo.
Those words moved Fugo's heart.
After that, Fugo underwent Polpo's test and gained Purple Smoke.
So this is Fugo's Stand...
Fugo's not here, but his Stand appeared for some reason.
Since that thing appeared, Fugo must be okay for the time being, but...
Damn it! Where the hell is Fugo?
How's he protecting himself?
Get back, Giorno!
Get back even further!
Fugo rarely lets this guy out.
He only does when he's in serious trouble.
Which means that Fugo's trying to fight somewhere!
Get further back, Giorno!
He seems to be more worried about that Stand than about where Fugo is.
He acts like he feels threatened.
What the? It just started attacking out of nowhere!
This isn't good. We really shouldn't stay here.
We're getting out of here! Come on!
I don't know what you're talking about!
There's something in that mirror!
We need to find where Fugo is!
Stop talking back to me, you little shit!
It punched it! Run, Giorno!
I see.
So you activated your Stand outside the mirror.
But... that doesn't mean a thing!
It doesn't matter what your Stand tries to do with its ability.
But I can hit you as many times as I like and finish you off!
A crow?
Why did a crow fall?
A crow just suddenly...
Stay back.
When Purple Smoke uses its fists, no one can stay nearby.
What the hell is with these corpses?
It's a killer virus.
That's Fugo's Stand, Purple Smoke's ability.
A virus?
Look at its hand.
and the virus comes spilling out!
The virus disperses into the air and enters your body
It then multiplies rapidly.
It infects its host within thirty seconds, then kills them instantly.
And once the virus spreads, it doesn't matter who's nearby, be they friend or foe.
That includes your Stand, too.
What's its range?
Five meters.
That's definitely important, but what's the range on the virus?
How close do you have to be to be infected by the virus?
At this distance, we should be safe.
The virus that comes from that capsule dies
So those crow corpses will soon be disinfected by the sunlight.
Savage!
It attacks like an explosion, and then disappears like a storm.
It's a Stand that personifies Fugo's violent nature.
What's it doing?
I think it's trying to wipe off the drool that dripped on its leg.
It always looks pissed off, but it's apparently
I guess you could say that's the Stand's idiosyncrasy.
It doesn't look like the Stand itself is very intelligent...
It's just a reflection of his violent side.
That would also mean Fugo's isn't able to see Purple Smoke.
He's not controlling it properly at all.
If he was, he wouldn't let it do that.
This corpse...
Is it sick?
Was it infected by some virus or bacteria?
I knew it... Fugo's unable to control it.
It just attacked some random spot again.
Wait, is it actually random?
There must be something in that mirror!
Now the mirror got attacked from the outside...
But it's no use, Fugo.
That's just a normal mirror, the kind you can find anywhere.
No matter what your Stand is doing out there...
Not even viruses can enter Mirror Man's world!
Abbacchio, Giorno, please get my message...
Please make sure you don't get dragged into the mirror!
We need to hurry, Giorno!
Hey, Giorno!
Don't just stand there! Let's go!
Let me ask you this... Where are we going?
You're willing to abandon Fugo, who's in danger right now?
Watch your mouth, you bastard.
Listen up. Our mission is to get the key and safely get that girl to the boss!
but getting that key is paramount right now!
I would want you guys to abandon me.
I beg your pardon...
Fugo is indeed in danger, but he hasn't lost!
We should risk our lives and save him!
And making any movements when we don't know the enemy's ability
No! All three of us being taken out is the worst possible outcome!
I'll say it again! We're moving on! Come on!
And I humbly decline!
We're going to solve this mystery, save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!
That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!
I have seniority here, so in this situation, what I say goes!
Are you still going to decline?
You'd better be prepared!
I'll ask you one more time, Fugo.
What are you looking for here?
I have no intention of telling you.
I see.
Very well. There are still two others.
I just need the last one standing to tell me.
You're finished. Take this!
Episodio 13 Mirror Man and Purple Smoke
What are you looking for here?
I have no intention of telling you.
I see.
Very well. There are still two others.
I just need the last one standing to tell me.
You're finished. Take this!
Footsteps... Someone outside the mirror is running.
Does that mean your friends decided to
They're heading toward the dog mosaic.
That settles it.
Fugo, you're basically done for already.
I'm going to go get whatever that thing is first!
W-Wait, you bastard!
Abbacchio... Giorno...
Where is it? Where is this key?
There it is. That must be it.
A mirror?
What is that? A key?
What?
I see.
I guess I just have to take that key from you.
That's... It couldn't be...
you're finished, too!
Episodio 13 Mirror Man and Purple Smoke
Sh-Shit!
Damn it...
So he's inside the mirror...
separating him from his Stand.
Regardless, right now, I need to grab that key!
Shattering the mirror actually worked in my favor, Abbacchio.
Anything reflected becomes an entrance to this world.
Now that it's in shards, I have even more entrances to grab you from!
And I'll give you, and only you, permission to come into the mirror!
There! I've brought you in.
I'll be taking that key, too!
Wh-What?!
O-Only a Stand can grab the neck of another Stand!
There's no way you could grab Mirror Man's neck when I'm the one who dragged you in here!
Shattering the mirror didn't actually work in your favor!
It just means the space you can look outside from became smaller!
You couldn't see who you dragged in here, could you?
You gave permission...
Th-That's...
Grazie! I'll happily get dragged in!
Moody Jazz!
Shit! That's a Stand!
Inside the mirror...
Of course we couldn't know.
Fugo must be in here, too.
So, how do we get out of here?
If I have to kill you to get out of here, that's fine.
The ability to transform into others...
Well, shit. You got me.
Looks like your Stand itself isn't that strong.
So, what? Can it only defeat powerless humans?
Well, what are you waiting for? Get on your feet and come at me!
Listen up... Like I said at the start, you're already done for.
but that doesn't change a thing!
The reason I'm not standing is so that I can crouch down.
I'm crouching because I need to!
Well, yeah.
You're bent over to make it easier to kick you.
I was crouching so I could pick up this shard of the mirror!
Hey, why are you so surprised?
Is it because I have this arm?
I'm sure you're very familiar with this arm!
I told you! Anything that reflects becomes an entrance!
that becomes another entrance!
Do you get it now?
It's your arm that I dragged in here!
To make sure you can't move about, I'll only allow half of your body to come in.
As for your Stand, I permit half of it to get out!
Now your Stand won't be able to move!
The key's mine!
Damn it. He's going to take the key.
That doesn't just mean we failed the mission.
It also means that Giorno will end up being correct!
And I humbly decline!
We're going to solve this mystery, save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!
That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!
Damn it... My pride's not going to stand for that!
I'm not letting him have that key!
will protect this key!
But if I do this to you, we don't exactly need strength to kill you off instantly!
If we just stab this in with the strength of a four-year-old child, it's pretty easy.
I win! Thanks for telling me where the key i—
Something wrong? Go on, finish me off!
What the hell are you doing, Abbacchio?!
Even if you can move with your current body, it won't be much!
I'll be able to tell immediately! Get it?!
Hide?
What are you talking about?
What exactly did I hide, and where?
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?
Let me see that hand!
Seriously, what the hell are you doing, you bastard?!
Did you lose something?
Did you find what you were looking for? Well?
Why did he do that to his own hand?
his Stand's hand outside the mirror is...
It can't be...
Its hand is gone!
Don't tell me...
I-It has the key!
And it's going back!
If I remember correctly, a newbie named Giorno is just around the corner!
He chopped off that hand to give him the key?!
You should've sliced open my throat when you had the chance.
If you had, my Stand's hand would've stopped moving.
Whoops, so close. But you're a bit too late.
That was the sound of the key falling to the ground.
The key is going to get picked up!
That's some bullshit you pulled off!
But I'm not letting that brat named Giorno get away!
I'll drag him in here, too!
Do you understand now, Giorno, you shithead?!
All that matters is that one of us returns safely.
If you return safely with the key...
The most important thing is to fulfill the mission.
Hey, Abbacchio.
Can you even imagine what's going on over here?
You sure have a loyal companion.
After you worked so hard to deliver the key...
What do you think's going on over here?
Not a damn thing!
That brat's not running away at all!
It looks like he doesn't have a clue what's going on.
Giorno! Get the hell out of here!
Take the key and run!
He won't hear you when you're screaming inside this mirror!
Sh-Shit...
Now then, there are two possible actions I could take.
First is disposing of Giorno after I get the key.
Second is slitting Giorno's throat first, then safely retrieving the key.
Let's see...
I guess I'll slit Giorno's throat first!
He's noticed me.
I'll allow only Giorno to enter!
I've dragged him in!
Slice open his throat, Mirror Man!
Wh-Wh-What?!
H-He's... That's impossible!
It's the virus! G-Giorno...
You're not getting the key!
And Fugo, Abbacchio, and I... will safely return to the others!
Pannacotta Fugo
Purple Smoke
Giorno Giovanna... That brat doesn't understand anything!
You're going to die if you infect yourself with Purple Smoke's virus!
My heart died along with him back then.
I don't feel anything anymore.
I don't feel a damn thing, even though I've lost my hand...
The only time I can feel at ease
Because then, all I need to do is be a soldier who doesn't have to think for himself.
Meaning...
Getting the key and protecting the boss's daughter...
Carrying out this mission is the most important thing.
And yet Giorno... That stupid brat...
He chose to put himself in danger to
save Fugo and me, rather than taking the key back safely!
Damn you, you stupid brat!
Are you out of your damn mind?!
Now I'm infected, damn it!
Ah, yes. You seem to be experiencing the same symptoms as me.
Apparently Purple Smoke's virus infects your whole body within thirty seconds.
It's over now.
It was over as soon as you dragged me in.
Shards of the mirror that Purple Smoke shattered...
Did Giorno put them back together?
When the enemy chased after Abbacchio, he took some shards with him.
Giorno must've realized that!
then infected himself with the virus and
allowed himself to be dragged into the mirror!
Because there's no other way to defeat this enemy!
Damn it! Of all the underhanded...
But don't underestimate me.
It's not too late yet.
I need more resolve, but it's not too late yet!
Mirror Man! Allow only me to leave this mirror!
But don't allow the virus!
The part of me that's infected is not allowed to leave!
That's not good!
Abbacchio lopped off his own hand to get the key.
So, I, Illuso, c-can do the same thing!
This is nothing!
Giorno! Grab him!
He got away...
Giorno... After you...
risked your own life to come in here...
So... he stepped outside the mirror.
Th-That was really close, but, ha!
My resolve... My resolve wins in the end!
This is nothing!
I figured he'd go outside.
That's for the best, though. He's going down, no matter what.
Now that he's stepped outside, there's a chance I might survive!
Fugo! Now that he's outside, Purple Smoke can follow him!
Finish him off!
I can't, Giorno.
I can't tell where he is from inside here.
I have no way to attack him!
I know where he is.
Golden Wind, who's outside, turned that brick into a snake.
That's why it's moving.
Snakes can tell where humans are by sensing their body temperature.
Got him!
What?!
This... This can't...
S-Stop it! Stop! Damn it!
I'm going to be infected! I-If that virus capsule bursts...
I-It looks like luck hasn't completely abandoned me!
If Mirror Man can stop this thing's punch even for a moment...
If I can just block it once...
Let him have it, Purple Smoke!
Mirror Man! Use everything you have left!
I...
I did it...
I stopped it! Now I just need to take this arm...
into the mirror!
Huh?
What?!
What?!
B-But I blocked its punch...
After I built up the resolve... to leave the mirror!
W-We did it! We're outside the mirror!
We defeated him, so his ability disappeared!
B-But Giorno, Purple Smoke's virus has already spread throughout your body.
Once you've been infected, even I can't do anything about it.
Yes, Fugo, and this is how it should be.
This...
Him leaving the mirror worked out for the best.
his defeat was inevitable.
But I was glad when he refused to admit defeat and left the mirror.
I was able to encounter this snake.
Th-That snake...
It's alive, even though it's surrounded by Purple Smoke's virus!
I created this snake from the brick where Purple Smoke's capsule was broken.
Since it was born from a place that was covered with the virus, it won't get sick.
Do you know what that means?
That snake has immunity!
And if we take blood or cells from something with immunity...
We can create a serum that'll stop the virus from spreading!
Golden Wind!
Extract the serum from this snake and inject it into me!
Giorno Giovanna...
but he comes up with the most insane ideas and pulls them off...
And there's something I can trust behind that.
It's not something that's spoken.
He has true loyalty within him!
Just like Bucciarati did back then!
Giorno! You have my utmost respect after risking your life!
No, Fugo...
I'm not the one who risked my life here.
I just made a prediction and followed through.
The one who truly risked his life here... was Abbacchio.
His hand is in grave condition right now.
He's the one who risked his life to protect the key...
we couldn't have defeated the enemy.
Please don't worry about me... and go tend to his wounds...
Giorno!
Are you okay, Giorno?!
Damn it, Giorno...
I was going...
But with my hand like this, I guess I can't.
I'll just have to do it later...
Thus, they got the key they were ordered to retrieve!
Special Program Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind
Narancia.
Huh?
Here.
Wait! Don't throw it!
You little shit!
Dang, talk about overreacting.
I just had it reattached thirty minutes ago...
It still hurts, damn it!
"I thank you for protecting my daughter, Bucciarati.
and use this key.
Then, take my daughter to Venice by train.
P.S. My missions for you will end once you get to Venice."
What's supposed to be by the drinking fountain at the station?
The boss mentioned a way for us to travel without being found by the enemy.
The station is dangerous, but we'll just have to trust him and go.
D-Do you think the boss is actually in Venice?
We don't need to think about that.
We're just going to do as we're ordered.
There's a super express leaving for Florence in ten minutes. We'll take that.
Mista, is anyone following us?
So far, we're good.
I can't say the same for the station, though.
There'll be plenty of paid guys who'll report information about us.
The boss's daughter, Trish.
Her life is being targeted because of a father she's never met.
I wonder how that feels...
Yeah, I get it, Fugo...
I can't help but stare at her you-know-whats, either.
Huh?
Th-That's...
Please forgive Fugo!
He didn't mean any harm!
He wasn't trying to take advantage of the sudden braking
He just couldn't help himself!
Hey, stop that!
I actually lost my balance, but you're making it sound worse!
Please don't tell the boss!
Episodio 14 Express Train to Florence
Florence bound leaving at 16:35 from platform 6
He's really here. That's Bucciarati.
I can't believe he actually showed up at a station where we could easily find him.
I'm gonna kill him!
or he's somehow confident that he'll be able to give us the slip.
Either way, I'm gonna kill him!
He killed Formaggio and Illuso! I'm gonna kill him!
Hey, dumbass.
Drop the "I'm gonna kill him" crap already.
That phrase doesn't exist in our world.
Only weaklings use that phrase.
our target is already dead, and the job is over!
So I've never uttered those words in my life.
You're gonna be that way too, right, Pesci?
If you're truly one of us.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah... I got it, Bro!
You can say, "I killed them!"
Prosciutto...
I'm going to head straight over there via the platform.
Got it!
We'll flank him.
We need the boss's daughter alive, after all.
Bucciarati, the train's about to leave.
Is something wrong?
There's no other drinking fountain on this platform, is there?
This key won't fit into this keyhole.
Not to mention...
you don't even need a key to open it.
It's just a stopcock.
Bucciarati, how about the lock on that fire hydrant?
The shape's completely different.
There aren't any locks or doors that this key will fit.
They just aren't here!
Should we pass on this train?
The next one departs in fifteen minutes and is bound for Rome.
No!
I'm sure some of our enemies know we're here and are heading to the station now.
We have to leave here immediately!
The sixth platform...
The drinking fountain with the turtle...
This has to be the spot!
Damn it! What's—
The turtle...
Hey, Pesci, why the hell am I running into you here?
I-I could ask you the same thing! Where did Bucciarati go?
Bucciarati hopped onto the train right in front of me.
It makes no sense that he didn't bump into you in the hallway.
Well? I'm right, aren't I?
I didn't run into anyone!
Bucciarati, his crew, the newbie, and the boss's daughter definitely aren't here!
Something's strange...
Bro, the train's about to leave.
They must be hiding somewhere inside this station.
They're gonna keep an eye on us tracking them and hop on another train to get away.
Let's use some homeless guy or something to search the station!
There was something placed at the drinking fountain.
He must've picked it up.
He picked up something that looked black!
Get on, Pesci!
But why?!
I just have a hunch.
but I think Bucciarati and the others are somewhere on this train.
You think?
You ?!
I'm sure the boss is helping them out somehow.
I have a feeling that if we don't board this train, we'll lose them forever!
A feeling?
Just shut up and get on, Pesci!
It takes takes three and a half hours to get from Naples to Florence by train.
It's an hour and a half non-stop to the next stop, Rome.
Aw, we ended up getting on...
Shut up!
Hey, the gap between the door and floor...
Isn't that the driver's cab?
But there's no way seven guys are in there.
You never know.
Use your Fisher Man to attack that room.
Do it.
Fisher Man!
There aren't seven guys in here...
There are two!
Got 'em!
Damn it. It really is small in there.
I guess there's only the driver.
Huh? Hey, wait a second.
There's only one?
I know I sensed two living things in there.
I could've sworn there was one more...
Hey, Pesci!
We're going to search this train from end to end!
We'll drag Bucciarati and his crew out!
But you stay here.
Huh?
If they realize we're here, they might come to stop the train.
You got it, Bro!
so they shouldn't be able to just move around or jump off this train easily.
That's going to give us our advantage.
We'll slaughter them all before we get to Rome and take the girl!
The key wasn't made to fit in a keyhole.
creating this space and making the key itself the entrance so that we could hide inside.
Th-The turtle is a Stand user?
O-Ow!
Wh-Where the hell am I?
I'm under the seat?
Ow!
B-But man, this is awesome!
This turtle is like some kind of spaceship!
But this room isn't some kind of illusion.
This is a real room.
Even the sofa and other furniture is real.
There are some chilled drinks in here.
I guess the boss left them in there for us.
Turtles like being in the shade, they aren't loud, and they don't scuttle about.
This way, we should be able to get to Venice by train without worry.
I guess there's no way someone would be in the locker...
I just don't have my bro's intuition.
B-Bro!
D-Don't tell me he...
The Thankful Death!
A-Are you really going to do it?
We don't even know if they're on this train!
I already told you
that I would be thorough about this!
They're definitely here.
Every year, there are lots of plane crashes all over the world.
This won't be as brutal as those.
Mr. President
Coco Large
You want a drink, too, Narancia?
Hey, are you even listening?
Huh? What was that?!
I'm asking if you want something to drink!
Why don't you get some rest while you're at it?
You look pretty tired.
I'll keep an eye on the ceiling.
Oh, okay!
My shoulders suddenly feel stiff, and my back hurts. There we go...
I'd really like something warm...
I told you, there are only cold drinks in here!
You never listen, do you?!
I'll just eat this banana, then.
Man, gardens like these make me sigh.
They're so beautiful...
I'd love to drown in nostalgia and think back on when I was a kid
Hey, stop that!
Huh? Did I do that?
Me? No way!
Hey, there's something hanging from your mouth.
Talk about gross. What the hell is that?
Hey!
A tooth?
I can't eat this banana for some reason...
It's all hard and dry...
Hey... Are you messing with us?
Man, you startled me... That sort of looks like a tooth.
I'm still pretty grossed out, so I can't really laugh...
What is that hanging from your mouth?
Huh? Did you say something again... Mista?
You're speaking too softly...
I couldn't hear you very well...
I'm telling you, this banana is crumbling...
I-I can't eat it...
Th-They're all dry...
Wh-What the hell is wrong with you?!
Didn't you hear me? Okay, then...
There's something wrong with your face!
N-Narancia, you...
I'll say it even louder this time!
Are you paying attention?! I can't eat this banana!
Look. It's just crumbling...
It's old, damn it...
Bucciarati!
I know! It's a Stand attack!
Th-There must be an enemy on this train!
Huh? What? What's this white stuff?
It came from my head...
What the hell is this?!
What's the matter?
Did something... happen?
Th-They've all aged!
Mama... Wake up... Wake up...
Mama... Mama...
Wake up...
Wh-Who the hell is th-this?
What? No way... This can't be!
This is me?!
What the hell's going on?
A-A Stand that makes people age?
Did they figure out we're in this turtle?!
Calm down, Mista.
If they knew we were inside this turtle, they would've used a more direct attack.
And since they haven't, that means we haven't been found yet.
The enemy probably only knows that we're somewhere on this train
they're attacking everyone on the train indiscriminately!
D-Does that mean this train is running with everyone on board affected?
Probably.
They're desperate. I'm sure they'll do anything...
And without a second thought.
This leaves us two choices.
One, take Trish and somehow get off this train.
Two, we find this enemy, even though we don't know their range, and dispose of them.
Obviously, we'll go with the second choice.
If we want to take her and run, we'll have to stop the train.
It's too dangerous.
with my Six Bullets!
Yes, you're right.
We're aging at an alarming rate...
B-Bucciarati...
M-My hands...
Th-They're crumbling!
They're falling apart!
You're right, Bucciarati. We really don't have any time!
Wait a minute, Mista...
It's too early... to go...
What the hell are you talking about, Giorno?
I'm telling you... it's too early to go...
We don't have any time to waste!
Wait.
Hear him out.
Why are we all aging at a different rate than Bucciarati?
Mista's and my symptoms are light...
Trish's are even less!
But why?
Apparently, we're just aging at different rates! I'm going!
No... If they're attacking everyone indiscriminately with age...
They might end up killing her as well, despite her being the target.
There's some kind of prerequisite to how fast we're aging.
I'll tell you what I think...
I think the enemy is differentiating between
I read somewhere that women have more fat in their bodies, which makes them
Apparently women also age better and live longer than men.
Don't you think it's been a little hot?
The enemy is differentiating the aging speed based on
slight differences in body temperature.
All that matters is that the men age faster and she ages slower.
but then why are you and I aging at different rates?
Are you insinuating that I'm a girl?!
Change in body temperature...
Come to think of it, our bodies were slightly cooler...
Because we had something cold to drink.
Narancia didn't have anything to drink.
Th-That's...
Giorno, it's exactly like you said!
We're aging slower because our bodies were slightly cooler!
Cool everyone down! Cool everyone down with ice!
Hold it, Mista!
Th-This is all that's left?
It doesn't change the fact that we have to dispose of this enemy.
Mista, you're going to take that ice and defeat the enemy...
Before the ice melts and you lose your Stand power!
Just the driver... It doesn't look like anyone else is in here.
It's so muggy...
This Stand really is attacking indiscriminately.
I wonder if this turtle is aging, too...
Guess they live longer than us.
Damn it...
What's Bro thinking? This is so dangerous.
What's he gonna do if I get old, too? Damn it...
The air conditioner?
Something took the bait!
Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!
A d-different Stand than the one that's aging us?
There's another one? There are two of them?
There are two enemies?!
Episodio 15 The Thankful Death Part 1
Let me see the key we obtained again.
Go to the drinking fountain with a turtle
and use this key.
Don't tell me he...
The Thankful Death!
Just the driver... It doesn't look like anyone else is in here.
There it is!
Something took the bait!
Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!
A d-different Stand than the one that's aging us?
Bro, where did you go?!
Episodio 15 The Thankful Death Part 1
Why aren't you here?!
Bucciarati and his crew were on this train!
But I wonder who I hooked. It's definitely not Trish.
The strength pulling on this rod belongs to a man.
The needle dug into his left hand.
I'll reel you right in!
Whoa, hang on a second... Th-This needle's sinking in deeper!
It's so fast!
Th-This line...
This must be Mista!
The thing that tried to cut the line was a bullet!
The gunslinger is Guido Mista!
You can't cut my Fisher Man's line!
I wonder where the impact that hit the line will end up going?
I'm gonna reel you right in!
I need to get this line out or I'm finished!
Damn it! It's going to make its way up to my brain!
Sh-Shit!
Six Bullets! Grab this hook and stop it!
I-It's no use! We're being pulled!
We can't stop it with our power!
Sh-Shit... I'm just going to have to look for it.
I'm just gonna have to find it!
Find it!
Find it!
We need to find it, no matter what!
Find it!
What was that?
Was that Mista's pistol?
Who the hell are you even shooting at?
What if you hit one of the other passengers?
Or did you shoot in hopes that you'd actually hit me?
It's no use!
The hook is about to travel deep into your ear!
We have to aim lower or the ice won't get blown out of the glass!
A bit lower! Aim a bit lower!
Over here! Blast right into it!
We found the ice!
Shatter it, boys!
What do you think you're doing?!
to the point that he'd lose his mind!
Damn it!
How could you?! The ice...
He's all pale and screaming.
My ice!
Could this guy be...
It's him!
He's the guy with the line and hook!
That fishing-rod-looking thing is his Stand!
R-Run for it!
Ice! I need to find some ice, or I'm going to die of old age, too!
H-Help me...
O-Out of my way, gramps!
Get your zombie hands off of—
My body feels so heavy, I don't want to move...
but now I don't want to eat it anymore...
Don't touch me!
Woohoo! We got his hand!
Call Mista over here now!
Mista!
Hurry up and get over here, Mista!
Mista, over here!
We found the enemy Stand user!
Six Bullets, all of you come back to the bullets.
but I'm going to ask you one very, very...
simple question.
I'll shoot a bullet into each of your eyes.
"Uno, due..." I won't wait any longer than that.
Got it?
All right. Here's the question.
Where the hell is your friend?
Uno...
H-Hell if I know! I don't know where he is, either!
Due... All right. Then die.
Hey... Please help me...
but now I don't wanna eat it anymore...
Hey! Get out of the way! You'll want to eat meat again soon enough!
No, I can't eat anything anymore...
Mista.
Wh-Who the hell are you?!
Thankful Death...
Huh? Wh-What?
W-Wait! Are you...
You bastard!
It works even faster when I directly touch you.
Its power is at full strength...
when Thankful Death touches you.
B-Bullets...
Th-This speed... Shit...
I-Is that you, Bro?
Are you my Bro?!
I-I didn't notice at all!
Y-You were there the whole time?
I-I can't believe you aged yourself to blend in with the other passengers...
Bro! Prosciutto! You're so awesome!
S-Stop! Why are you so mad, Bro?!
You friggin' moron! What the hell was that?! Huh?!
I didn't know he was going to ambush me!
You still don't get it? Pesci, you friggin' mammoni!
Please stop hitting me, Bro!
Listen up! The reason I'm mad is because you're so weak-minded, Pesci!
Of course, they did blast away your ice, so you were in shock.
This is aging me, too, so it's bad news.
Even if they lost an arm or a leg!
You're a damn mammoni, Pesci.
It's not because of the ice.
Grow up, Pesci.
If you don't grow up, we'll never get our glory.
And just so we're clear...
Our team isn't some buddy-buddy club with a bunch of losers
the deed's already been done!
Let's go, Pesci.
Here, have some ice.
You mentioned earlier
that you sensed another presence in the driver's cab, didn't you?
but the girl's in the driver's cab!
Prosciutto
The Thankful Death
Don't worry about Narancia!
Save the ice in the glass for yourself!
You need to keep your body chilled.
Fanning air and the chill from a cold towel aren't enough.
There's no effect unless you use ice.
At this rate, he'll be the first to die.
Narancia and the rest of us are willing to risk our lives to follow the boss's orders.
You just need to think about your safety.
That's our job.
You're not here because you want to be here, after all.
And as for the enemy who's causing us all to age...
Mista will take care of him.
I'm sure... he'll do something...
Mista...
Where and how are they hiding?
I'm finally getting it.
I need to start thinking in four dimensions to find them.
Bucciarati received something black at the station platform from the boss.
That's it. That's what I need to find in this driver's cab.
Hey, Pesci.
What do you think that presence you felt in this driver's cab was?
You don't feel it now?
A-About that... Bro...
You shouldn't expect much from me.
I'm not the brightest.
Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci...
I believe in you.
Your Fisher Man is unbeatable when you actually apply yourself.
Right?
It's do or die time, Pesci.
It's okay to be confident in your ability.
R-Really?
Yes!
Try to remember. It doesn't matter how trivial it seems.
Did anything seem strange?
Like maybe something black?
Huh? Something... black?
That's it, Bro!
There was something weird!
S-Sorry... I guess I was just imagining it.
So, yeah... You shouldn't count on me or my intuition, after all...
No, I don't think you're wrong.
Say what?!
Excellent work, Pesci.
The mystery's been solved.
I now understand everything thanks to you.
B-Bro? Wh-What are you...
Why is there suddenly animal shit under the driver's seat?
I don't understand at all!
This isn't mouse shit, either.
If it were a mouse, it'd be dead by now.
This shit's not old. It looks like it was just left here.
So what does that mean, huh?
Stand abilities don't only belong to humans.
And that means...
Thankful Death!
Wh-What the hell is that?!
I-It's a turtle? It's a friggin' turtle?!
We found her! It's Trish!
I can see the others, too!
Just as I thought, they're all about to die of old age, except for Trish!
That settles it!
Thankful Dead!
Wait a sec, Bro!
Isn't there... one guy missing?
There's someone missing in there!
Mista! Please get up!
This is all the ice I have left, but please feel better!
or if I was just lucky...
But because I put that piece of ice I'd picked up earlier into my hat...
Number Five... It seems you were able to reverse the aging.
Thanks for stopping those bullets for me... All three of them.
Number Five... I have one more request...
He took the ice in your pocket and
That's perfect... I don't need the ice anymore...
Mista!
It's Bucciarati, Bro!
Bucciarati's the one missing!
It doesn't matter if Bucciarati's in there or not!
Thankful Death!
What the hell?!
You're pretty intuitive... And fast, too.
I just have to defeat him, right?
That's right, Bucciarati!
If you defeat him, everyone's aging will be reversed!
What the hell is Mista's Stand doing here?!
I personally blasted three holes into his head...
So why is that thing here with an ice cube?!
Don't let that thing touch you!
If it does, you'll age way, way faster!
Get 'em!
H-He's fast...
Bro!
Don't worry about me!
Hurry it up! Kill the rest of his crew!
That was a little naïve, wasn't it, Bucciarati?
After Mista went to all that trouble to warn you...
Defeating me, even if it costs the lives of your crew, to protect the girl...
Isn't that your mission?
You fail as a capo. Take this!
What?!
and I will also protect my crew.
It won't be hard for me to do both if I'm only facing the likes of you.
It's fast...
It's definitely fast...
Your... Zipper Man, was it?
It's definitely faster...
But you're the one who doesn't seem to understand speed, Bucciarati!
I seem to be out of breath...
But the same goes for you, Bucciarati.
Since we used our Stands at full speed, we both used up a lot of energy.
even though you're still aging despite standing still!
The more horsepower a car has, the warmer it gets!
That's because you're burning calories.
what'll happen when your body gets warmer!
B-Bucciarati!
Th-The ice is starting to lose its effect!
So what are you going to do now, huh?
This zipper you gave me is starting to close.
The zipper on my chin is already gone.
What's the matter?
Exhausted from your stiff shoulders?
Zipper Man!
I can see your movements! You're too slow, Bucciarati!
I've got you! Now you're all finished!
And then we'll be taking the boss's daughter!
I was aware of what would happen if my body warmed up.
I was also prepared to get caught.
I will complete this mission.
One of the hardest parts of being a capo is the fact that I have to do both.
Are you prepared?
I am.
Wha—
Y-You can't mean...
You bastard! You can't be serious!
and we'll be able to protect Trish!
You bastard! Y-You can't be serious! Let go!
We're moving at 150 kilometers per hour!
Oh, come on, now. You're the one who grabbed me.
Are you trying to die?! You bastard!
Episodio 16 The Thankful Death Part 2
Episodio 16 The Thankful Death Part 2
Pesci! What the hell are you doing?!
Pesci!
Hurry up and stop the train!
Pesci!
B-Bro!
Stop the train!
Bro!
I-I don't know how to stop it!
Now you and your aging ability will both disappear.
Then my crew will return to normal, and Trish will be safe!
You bastard...
Bucciarati!
Bro!
What?!
Prosciutto!
W-Well done, Pesci!
Excellent work! That was quick thinking!
That was close...
Now my hook will never let him go!
B-But this is definitely the weight of two people!
Bucciarati must be hanging on, too!
I seriously thought I was done for, Bucciarati.
I called you a failure of a capo, but I take that back now.
I apologize for my rudeness.
You are able to make decisions impartially.
You're even able to risk your own life.
The boss made the right decision, leaving Trish in your hands.
I'm actually astonished.
However, Bucciarati...
You're an unlucky capo!
Now, fall into the hell of 150 kilometers per hour!
Zipper Man!
Did you forget?
Too slow!
You know... I was saved by that line your little bro sent out.
He wasn't aiming for me.
There was no way Mista should have been alive!
I fired three bullets straight into his head.
The fact that he's alive
is as messed up as someone saying the sun rises in the west!
I happened to let him know
that the energy from an attack on the line
gets sent back to the one who's hooked!
Impossible!
Bucciarati!
It's one person lighter now!
We did it, Prosciutto!
Looks like the aging is wearing off.
Now we just have to deal with the fishing hook guy!
Yeah.
Earlier, my Fisher Man's hook definitely dug into Bro's right hand...
His pinky was on the right side of the hook.
But right now...
The pinky is on the left side of the hook.
This is someone's left hand!
What the heck's going on?
Whose hand is on the other end?
How did Bro's right hand switch to his left?!
N-Now that I think about it... Bro also seems just a bit heavier...
H-Hey, you!
Make them stop the train! I think everyone on this train is sick!
I'm starting to feel much better, but...
I've lost some teeth!
Th-The aging has stopped!
Hey, are you listening to me?!
Have the driver stop the train, quick!
It can't be...
Don't tell me the weight that was flung from the line was...
It can't be!
It can't be! It can't be true!
Don't tell me that Bro...
Are you listening to me, you dumbass?!
I'm talking to you! You, right there!
My bro, Prosciutto!
What should I do? What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?
No way! The guys inside the turtle are going to come out, too!
Wh-What should I do? What should I...
What the hell are you even saying?!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up, damn it!
You some kind of mammoni?!
Fine. I'm starting to feel better, so I'll tell them my—
Wh-What's going on?
The aging hasn't stopped!
Bucciarati, y-you're...
Impossible...
Don't tell me... Don't tell me he...
What?!
Thankful... Death...
Bro!
You were right, Bro... You were totally right.
You said we should never
Bro...
With the mess his body's in, th-there's no way he can survive...
and yet he isn't releasing his Stand's ability!
We have to get Trish, no matter what, right, Bro?
We can't turn back now...
I get it now, Prosciutto!
I understand your resolve
but within my heart.
the deed has already been done!
That's the first time I did someone in.
But it wasn't as big of a deal as I thought it'd be.
And now, there's no one left
to call me a mammoni.
Pesci
Fisher Man
I'm going to settle this once and for all
before Bro's ability disappears!
Bucciarati! You need to hurry up and remove that hook!
Yeah.
You opened up your hand with a zipper.
He can tell what I'm trying to do?
I'll read all of his actions!
I'll make the hook travel from his hand down his wrist and to his forearm!
The hook's traveling further up your arm!
The hook is out again!
And he's powerful!
I'm not going to lose track of your body!
And I'm going to get Trish and make sure Prosciutto's will is seen through!
Bucciarati! The bastard down there!
If we finish him once and for all, Giorno and the others will stop aging
and take care of the fishing line guy!
I know, but that's proving quite difficult to do, too!
I'll make you suffer the same agony my Bro is going through!
Bucciarati!
He's hanging on to something.
In that case... You can just go up!
You're heading right for those electrical wires!
Get chopped in half!
I felt an impact, but he didn't get chopped in half or fall off.
I feel a heartbeat through the line.
He's entered the train!
That was close, Bucciarati!
At this point, we're gonna have to face him head-on!
Yes... But that's going to be difficult, as well.
We won't make it in time.
What?!
The distance between the hook and your heart is now twelve centimeters...
I underestimated the situation.
The enemy that posed a greater threat on this train
The one who's even more terrifying
is the guy using this fishing line!
So what are you gonna do?!
Nine centimeters, eight centimeters...
Then I don't have any choice.
I'm just going to have to show him
that my resolve is superior to his!
Zipper Man!
What the hell are you doing?!
Bucciarati!
He disappeared!
I can't feel his pulse or the vibration from his breathing...
Why?!
How did I lose his presence?
How?!
How can you do something so insane, Bucciarati?!
I know there's no other way...
But seriously, are you going to be okay?!
Quiet... down.
Wait until he goes away.
This is what it means to have resolve... Number Six.
Damn it, I can't find him!
Bucciarati can go anywhere with his zippers!
Could he be heading here from s-some direction?
No, wait. Calm down...
Jumping at shadows is a sign of weakness!
That's what Prosciutto would tell me!
Be more confident, Pesci.
That's what he'd say!
There's no way Bucciarati can move quickly right now!
He must still be somewhere near the hook!
H-He's extending the line even further!
Quickly, pull yourself together and run!
For now...
I can make it through this as long as I don't move.
The fact that I'm not doing anything right now
shows my resolve.
His heartbeat, his pulse... Look for those two things.
Borgh
Got one! But that's not him!
The weight isn't right.
It must be another passenger!
This is... It's weakened, but that's the sound of a heart!
N-No! He's going to find your heart!
How could you do such a thing?!
This is insane!
How long can humans live when their heart and breathing have stopped?
D-Damn it! It's not there!
D-Did he move somewhere else using his zippers after all?
Y-You're reaching your limit!
Where the hell did he go?!
Don't tell me that Bucciarati
actually managed to finish off Prosciutto...
Once the aging stops, the rest of Bucciarati's guys will step out of that turtle!
God damn it!
I'm not gonna let that happen!
W-We did it! He gave up on this cabin!
Your resolve made him search elsewhere!
You managed to make it through!
Hurry up and zip your body back together! Hurry it up!
Un...believable...
How unlucky...
Bucciarati! Pull yourself together!
My only expertise is controlling bullets!
I don't have enough energy to move stuff that's bigger than me!
He was more stubborn than I thought...
He's... won...
Stop, you damned train!
What the heck?!
B-Bro!
This was definitely a difficult path
that I wouldn't have been able to traverse without some luck.
The path leading closer to you, that is.
You're going to pay, Bucciarati...
You got close to him! Your resolve won out, Bucciarati!
...right in front of Bro, before he's gone for good.
What the hell?!
I'm surprised you were able to see through that attack!
His eyes and face...
I feel such intensity and calmness from his eyes.
Trickery won't work against him.
Do it... Victory is in your hands... Pesci...
Do it... I'm watching... over you...
I will murder you!
What?!
I knew you'd do that!
Going up someone's arm to get to their heart was a surefire plan
When I'm confident I won't miss, I go straight for the heart!
Right now, I'm going to go straight for everything!
I'm gonna murder you! I'll rip your heart out, Bucciarati!
You're supposed to say that after you've actually done it.
In the world of gangsters, that is.
Did I... lose?
Am I... going to die?
But... I'm not... just going to die!
Go ahead... and take her... and run...
I'll let Trish live...
He's got the turtle!
Wh-Where am I?
But before I die...
I'll leave your heart in despair!
The despair of losing your crew!
I'm going to smash this turtle to pieces!
Holy shit! That's not good!
Earlier, I saw nobility and resolve that was hardened like a diamond, shining in your eyes.
But you've fallen.
Now you're just a piece of shit.
Fallen? Fallen, you say?!
The only ones who are going to fall and get crushed are these bastards!
You won't make it in time! I hope you enjoy hell, Bucciarati!
You're going to fail, no matter what, when you're a piece of shit.
Arrivederci.
"Goodbye"
Stand Name: Fisher Man
As I figured, we won't be able to continue riding this train.
Yeah.
There's no way they haven't contacted the rest of their crew.
I'm sure they told the others about our destination and the turtle.
We'll have to use another form of transportation from here.
There's something I want to ask you.
Are you willing to give me an answer?
I haven't been given permission to answer any of your questions.
Our mission is solely to be your bodyguards.
You going to answer me.
Who am I?
What the hell is this?
What's this on the ground?
Why can I suddenly see such bizarre things?
Why is my life in danger because of a father I don't even know?!
As I thought... The boss's daughter is a Stand user.
Answer me!
Bruno Bucciarati
Zipper Man
It's currently 6:34 PM.
I got here twenty minutes after the train stopped.
Prosciutto is dead next to the tracks.
Parts of Pesci's body, which has been torn to pieces, are on the riverbank.
Judging from the scene, the one who disposed of them is Bucciarati's Zipper Man.
I see. Where are those guys and the girl?
They're long gone.
You gonna be able to track them, Melone?
Yeah.
Everything the two who have fallen managed to do will make tracking them possible.
I've managed to collect a blood sample.
Bucciarati's, that is.

JoJo, what are you doing?
Well, I have a theory that he's not a bad guy after all.
I'm testing it out.
I think it's wrong to assume someone is evil.
Don't be an idiot!
Look at these dead soldiers!
Nonsense! You reap what you sow!
You experimented on him and blasted him with guns!
Besides, Speedwagon, I came here
I have no reason to fight.
Now, everyone! Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!
What's this guy's problem? He's just ignoring me.
I'm a bit upset.
Fine. I'll just stick my foot out and trip him!
W-What happened?
Th-That was the strangest sensation.
This is new to me.
What is this tool?
He spoke! He really does understand!
Somehow he's mastered our language!
A-Amazing!
He's pulling it apart like an expert watchmaker!
Soldiers need hours of drilling in order to do that!
H-His intelligence is incredible!
So bright.
This light is also new to me.
We weren't the ones observing!
It was him watching us!

I have never seen such a human.
Is he a unique specimen?
Or all humans of this age the same?
It appears that human is unique.
JoJo, this is horrible!

The Hamon is making that blood...!
It's not working!
My Hamon is running off of him like rain
His skin is acting like a ground just like Straizo's scarf!
My body and his body repel each other.
M-My hand...
...it's...
...it's...
...still there.
Just a little joke.
I rolled my wrist forward in the nick of time!
But this is a serious pickle. He's immune to Hamon!
What should I do?
No, he's not!
Hamon works! It's protecting you!
It keeps his body from eating you!
Fool! What do you do when you eat a blowfish?
You kill it, remove the poison parts and eat!
It will be no different for Santviento!
Well this is a perfect mess! I have to think of something fast!
I need an escape plan at least!
Absolutely not! You can't let Santviento get out!
He's a danger to mankind!
Shut up! Don't talk like you didn't have a hand in this!
And you think I need more pressure?!
I'll send Hamon right into his body through this knife!
His skin is bending like rubber!
But can you dodge this?!
Here's Hamon in your eye!
This is a surefire hit!
Wha-What?!
Even his eyes are like rubber!
No! JoJo, get out of there!
JoJo!
He won't be able to breathe after being hit there!
He seems to create energy in his blood through breathing.
But while unconscious, he's an ordinary human.
JoJo! Use your Hamon breathing!
Breathe, damn it!
Use your Hamon breathing!
JoJo!
This is the end! I have to use the self-destruct!
For the Fatherland!
For eternal glo--
Hold it, von Stroheim!
No need to panic!
I took a big gamble.
Attacks from outside are no good.
So I'll send Hamon into him while he eats.
JoJo!
I was waiting for him to try this!
This is perfect!
Enjoy your Hamon treat!
I-I get it now.
After entering that foul body, I understand its digestive process.
Each of his cells uses digestive fluid
That's why he appears to absorb his opponents.
I'm only safe because I sent Hamon into him as he tried to dissolve me.
But your Hamon was too weak!
It wasn't enough to destroy Santviento!
Chunks of his body are trying to reform!
Straizo did something like this, so I figured you would do the same!
Von Stroheim!
Pay attention!
Does sunlight hurt him?!
Y-Yes!
Joestar, it was written on the walls of the cave!
Sunlight will hurt him!
What are you doing, Joestar?!
That door leads outside!
I'll destroy you with sunlight!
He's running out of breath! He'll lose control of his Hamon!
He hasn't trained with it, so the battle has tired him!
Cease this foolishness, primitive!
JoJo, use your Hamon breathing!
If I could breathe, I wouldn't be so tired!
Damn it!
I've had more than enough of you!
I'm dragging you up these stairs so you can do some sunbathing!
What the...?!
Heavy... I feel so heavy.
Wh-What's happening?
Meat Invade, also known as Foul Flesh.
Bits of Santviento are attacking!
They're draining me!
Y-You son of a...
Keep moving...
I never expected such a human to be born while I slumbered.
Leave the rest to me, Rudol von Stroheim!
It's just this door, right?
I believe I can handle that for you!
Von Stroheim, you...
Cursed peasants.
Just a few centimeters more!
A meaningless struggle.
This is trouble.
Joestar, could you do me a favor?
What is it?! I'm trying to think! Be quiet!
Listen to me!
You see the axes on the wall? Can you reach one?
Use one to chop off my leg!
Wh-What?!
Use an axe to hack off my leg! Then I can reach the door!
B-But...
You're really asking me to do that?!
Just do it! He's starting to reform!
Don't ask me! I'm not a doctor!
I'm a proud servant of the Wehrmacht! I am prepared to do my duty!
I would proudly give a few legs for the sake of the Fatherland!
Do it now, Joestar!
Quit fussing!
If you want me to chop, I'll chop!
I want you to chop!
I figured he was all hot air, but when
We think differently, but I respect your courage.
Forgive me!
How do you feel now that you're in the sun?!
Did we do it?
Wh-What?!
He's crawling into the wound in my leg!
Get out of there!
This is a shock!
Von Stroheim is safe and Hamon-free!
Santviento is inside me!
What a fearsome creature!
What tenacity to live!
If he's inside von Stroheim, he is safe even in sunlight!
S-Such horror!
This is horrifying!
Do you know what frightens me, Joestar?
My leg doesn't hurt. In fact, it feels quite pleasant!
Von Stroheim!
Hold on!
Y-You won't...
Joestar!
You've seen what Santviento, the ultimate being, can do.
There is no hope for me.
I'll use this to destroy both of us.
But I must tell you something before I die.
So listen up, you annoying Englishman.
The Wehrmacht did not awaken Santviento
What?
Why so suddenly?!
Listen!
It is your destiny to hear this!
Recently the Wehrmacht discovered another Pillar hidden in Europe!
W-What?!
Von Stroheim, are you serious?!
That means Santviento is not unique.
The Pillar Men have slept for millennia and we seek their fantastic powers!
Soon, they will awaken.
If a weakness other than sunlight cannot be found, all is lost.
That is why we had to experiment on Santviento.
Events fifty years ago have destined you to fight the Pillar Men!
Joestar, your Hamon is too weak to overcome them!
Go to Rome! Someone awaits you there!
It is a man Speedwagon knows well!
H-He's trying to control my body and make it hide in that well!
But soon I'll open myself up and let the sun shine in!
Von Stroheim, you can't...
Human greatness is in proudly facing down one's fears.
The words of the Greek historian Plutarch.
Farewell...
...you annoying Englishman!
Don't do it! I still have questions!
Damn that crazy soldier!
Putting on a show like that...
Santviento!
Get out of my way! If you don't, you'll die, JoJo!
Steady your breathing. Use your Hamon breathing.
Move it! You were doomed from the start!
A-And now you'll say, I see through you, primitive!
I see through you, primitive!
It's high noon.
The sun is above and reflecting off the water. That'll cook you good.
Try jumping into the well after thinking about the movement of the sun!
I'm not letting you fall into the water!
I-I'm alive thanks to the sun.
It's turned him into a solid statue!
Next episode
My grandfather died tragically.
Then you couldn't even beat a pigeon!
Bring out more UV lamps!
Awaken, my masters!
Chapter 14: Elite Ancient Warriors
You gonna be able to track them, Melone?
Yeah.
I've managed to collect a blood sample.
Bucciarati's, that is.
Hey, when's this train gonna get underway?
Please, just wait a little bit longer.
We have another driver on the way right now!
What? What happened to the first one?
Ugh, talk about annoying.
I knew I shouldn't have gotten on this train with all these peasants.
Miss.
How's your health?
H-Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
This is my compartment!
Do you have anything with your birthdate written on it?
Uh...
Oh.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Born March 10, 1977. Twenty-four years old.
Very... bellissimo.
A very good age.
Don't touch my things!
Get out!
Smack
So good...
What a magnificent slap.
in excellent health.
"Health: excellent."
And judging by the taste of your fingers, your blood type is O.
Right?
What's your deal? Are you a thief?
My family—
Ah, I don't need your name.
I don't care about where you were born or your upbringing.
your birthday, and your blood type.
A Pisces and type O!
And that's so perfect!
Looks like you drink and smoke, as well.
Do you do any drugs?
If you're doing any drugs...
I-If you want money, I have it... If you want more, I have a credit card...
Listen.
Could you be quiet and listen?
This next question is the most important of all.
What's important here is your preference.
Which do you prefer?
And I think it's really important...
as the beginning that leads to the birth of an excellent child.
Now, choose.
Babyhead!
H-H-Help me!
Help me!
Conception complete
3 minutes until birth
Analyzing the DNA from Bruno Bucciarati's blood sample. Would you like to integrate the DNA into a body and nurture it so that it can be tracked?
Oh, yes. We're going to nurture it...
1: Yes. 2: No.
Di molto...
Episodio 17 Babyhead
Man... Everyone seems super bummed.
I wonder if Bucciarati said something harsh to Trish.
No... I think she's worried because Bucciarati hasn't told her anything.
Trish is probably a Stand user, but hasn't realized it.
She has all sorts of questions on her mind.
But Bucciarati is forbidden to speak about any of those things.
I'd like to look more into her abilities.
They'd probably offer some hints about the mysterious boss.
She's very strong-willed.
Mista!
Tell Number Two and Number Three to share the hamburger with us!
Huh? What are you talking about?
Huh?
Where the hell did you get that?!
D-Don't tell me...
Why'd my hamburger disappear?
There's something under the seat.
Sh-Shit!
A turtle?
What are we going to do, Mista?
It looks like some kind of jewel... Is it a key?
This seems bad.
What just happened?
Mista, you were keeping watch on the ceiling, weren't you?
Huh? Me?
I-I haven't the slightest. I wasn't watching at that moment...
Huh? Maybe the truck stopped...
Birth complete
Ow!
What happened?
Th-This...
D-Don't tell me I—
Thank goodness. Nothing happened.
That stupid asshole!
What the hell was up with that creepy bastard?!
How dare he make me think I was about to die?!
I wanna kill him, damn it!
That piece of shit!
Hello? Are you the conductor of this train?
Come to my compartment, right now!
What does "kill" mean?
Looks like they were born.
They're starting to learn from their mother.
Babyhead's child, that is...
And this is great!
Make us proud!
I'm telling you, some creepy bastard attacked me here! He attacked !
It's because you have that poor excuse for a lock on the door!
There's even a bump on my head!
Ugh, I'm so pissed!
What does... "kill" mean?
I'm going to sue the hell out of you guys! This is unbelievable!
What does... "piece of shit" mean?
Would you like to learn some more?
Okay, pay close attention.
This is Mr. Lion. He's the king of beasts.
The one eating the grass is Mr. Zebra.
And...
This is what "kill" means. Do you understand?
It means to make them die, or to get rid of them.
Next... Oh, we have some children's games.
A spinning top and baseball.
This is bowling, and these are ice skates.
Oh, dear! Look at how handy these things are when you use them like this!
The ones who died are the pieces of shit.
You use "piece" when there's only one and say "pieces" when there's more than one.
Do you understand?
But you can kill them in whatever way your instincts tell you to.
However, you are forbidden to attack this girl named Trish.
You need to capture her alive.
There is also a newbie whose face we haven't seen yet.
They're with Bucciarati as well, so you need to find them and kill them.
I have to pee. What should I do?
What should you do?
Babies pee all the time.
But it doesn't look like the lock's been broken...
H-Hey, what is this?!
There's something leaking from the ceiling of this stupid train!
I don't see anything...
I-It stinks!
What is this?! It's so dirty and gross!
Miss...
Mommy said that I stink. She's also screaming that I'm "dirty and gross."
So it seems. And how does that make you feel about her?
What a great mommy!
Yes!
Di molto! This is extremely wonderful!
You're learning so well!
I'm hungry... What should I do?
Not yet. You haven't learned enough yet.
Let me drink! Hurry and let me drink!
Hey, not yet! I told you, not yet!
I can't take this anymore!
I'll sue the train company and make sure they take responsibility for all this!
I'll tell them the bump on my head is a concussion, too...
Huh? I don't hear her anymore...
She was too good of a mother!
It's good that she taught him the desire to kill first, but this is too early!
H-Hey!
Bucciarati's DNA is currently not moving... It's idle somewhere up north.
What am I going to do with you?
I guess I can't deny your talents, though.
It looks like the automatic tracking of Bucciarati's DNA has kicked in.
It's a hassle, but Babyhead's son is an invincible, remote-controlled Stand.
Nothing can defeat you!
Melone
Babyhead
Let's just steal one already.
Are you stupid?
Word would spread in no time and go right to the enemy.
Then they'll just be waiting to ambush us!
That's true.
Fugo's got a good point.
Then let's hear what Bucciarati wants us to do.
Wh-What are you doing, Giorno?
If we steal only one, we'll be caught immediately.
But if we steal a hundred...
and it should give us plenty of time to get to Venice.
I see...
That definitely beats hitchhiking.
Whatever.
Giorno, you tell Bucciarati.
Here.
We're going to go get a car.
Please get down from the chair.
It's very dangerous outside right now.
Listen, Mr. Bucciarati.
If I were to ask you a dumb question, would you be able to answer it?
It depends on the question.
What am I supposed to do if I need to go to the bathroom?
You aren't suggesting that I use a diaper, are you?
I see... That's a very good question.
Good. I'm glad you understand.
Let's make the closet a toilet.
Please, go ahead.
Go ahead?
You said you had to go to the bathroom.
I don't know where it leads underneath that, but I'm sure the turtle will be fine.
It might actually get nutrients from it.
I have no idea what you're trying to say...
Bucciarati, we've procured a car.
All right. Once we confirm that we're safe, let's head out.
Understood.
That bike... When did it show up here?
Where's the person who was riding it?
Giorno, is something wrong?
Trish?
What the hell?!
Trish!
I-Impossible!
Trish!
Zipper—
Shit... It's a Stand, and a remote-controlled one!
But this power isn't remote-controlled. What's—
Bucciarati, please be on your guard.
Bucciarati?
Don't tell me... Bucciarati!
Where's Trish? Trish!
I had the turtle in my hands this whole time...
I'd know if they came outside.
Could the enemy have already used some kind of attack?
Golden Wind!
Di molto!
I've captured the boss's daughter, Trish, and Bucciarati as well. What should I do now?
Di molto! Well done, Babyhead!
Get away from there immediately, of course!
I'm currently inside a turtle... There's one human waiting at the exit of the turtle.
I've never seen him before. He's going to find me on my way back. What should I do?
Someone you've never seen?
That must be the newbie.
If he finds you, you're going to have to get rid of him.
I will get rid of the newbie who's waiting at the turtle's exit.
But make sure you do it quietly so you aren't found by the others.
Capturing Trish takes top priority.
I'll have them head over there as well, just in case.
I thought I felt a presence there, but...
No, you were correct.
Everyone! There's an enemy here! We're being atta—
D-Did it take... my throat?!
Are you done yet, Mista?
Don't rush me!
Is something wrong?
Nah. Giorno's waving.
I'm pretty sure Bucciarati's telling us to hurry up and get the car.
I just told you not to rush me!
The attack was successful. It's very quiet, because I stole part of his throat.
Di molto! Well done!
Impossible! I destroyed the cabinet, but it's still not showing itself?
And how am I not able to see it the moment it attacks me?
Where is it hiding, and how is it carving out pieces of me?
Carving out pieces... Which means...
Shpang
So you've carved away his leg and eye, too?
Di molto! Well done! Now, come back, Babyhead!
Obviously, he's figured out what I am. What should I do?
What?
The newbie outside has removed the key from the turtle's back.
Apparently, when someone removes the key, only living things can leave.
My body is floating upward. What should I do?
I'm not sure what you're saying... Living things?
You're a Stand! It doesn't matter if you're living or not.
That's true, but right now, I have the eye that I stole from him. His eye is living.
I knew it... It was that cabinet.
I see now...
It's not that I couldn't see the enemy.
This ability chops up humans and reconstructs them into something else!
What should I do?
Don't panic! Who cares if he figured out your ability?
The newbie hasn't been able to breathe for a while, and he's missing a leg, right?
Just defeat him already and steal the turtle, along with Trish!
Roger.
Golden Wind!
It's dodging by splitting itself apart!
Which means...
G-Guys...
That had some effect!
No, that was just a rock.
Sh-Shit...
Trish is going to get taken...
At this rate, Bucciarati will be eliminated!
I-It's strong...
I will leave the newbie's corpse here.
As planned, I've quietly captured Trish.
Di molto! Good!
I'm heading back to the train you're on now, Melone.
Reconstructing humans into objects...
Your ability gave me an excellent hint.
Your ability is similar to my Golden Wind.
They're very much alike in the way that they both recreate something.
it would appear...
that I've grown a little.
M-Melone, did you hear that?
I totally forgot earlier, but now I know the newbie's Stand ability.
What about the newbie?
His button has become an eye! In his hand! It became an eyeball!
Hey, Babyhead, what are you talking about?
He inserted the eye into his face!
ble
His ability is to create life!
He created his own parts!
Hey, who the hell are you talking about?
You're not getting away! Golden Wind!
The newbie... He...
He's been revived!
A-Are you listening, Melone?
He made parts of the motorcycle into roots!
I can't separate them!
I need to get away from the bike!
Did it turn into a rock again?
This isn't good. He's going to try to pick up the turtle.
Calm down, Babyhead!
Let him pick up the turtle.
What do you mean?
The moment he picks up the turtle, tear him apart for good.
Oil's pouring out. That's not good!
Make sure he can never get up again!
I got him!
It was only a little bit, but how dare you freak me out, you bastard?!
Now, I'm going to rip your head—
I've learned a lot from your ability to turn humans into objects.
I'm not sure if it's fate or if our Stands were attracted to each other
But because of you, my Golden Wind was able to grow.
Wh-Where did it go?
I just tore off your wrist. Where did it go?
Tore off?
I intentionally let it go.
I'd like to give you a little advice.
You should probably use your hand to defend yourself, rather than attack me.
D-Don't you dare underestimate me!
Take this!
What?!
The hand that I cut off has already become another living creature
Yes.
As you can see, it turned into a piranha!
Episodio 18 Head to Venice!
I should be able to meet up with Melone in about an hour.
Ghiaccio, I'll leave the situation to you and Melone.
You can never be too careful.
I'll stay here and try to figure out where they're headed.
Got it, Risotto.
How much longer are you going to make me wait? Hurry up.
Risotto.
Do you really think you can get away with betraying Passione?
We're a bit short on time.
Next will be your left eye.
As long as you have your right hand and right eye, you can still work.
You should know better than anyone!
Episodio 18 Head to Venice!
What?!
The hand that I cut off has already become another living creature
and invaded your body.
As you can see, it turned into a piranha!
There's a huge hole that goes all the way to its head...
and it can still move?
Wh-What's wrong, Babyhead?
Answer me! Hey!
This is turtle shit...
This is literally shit that the turtle left behind!
Why the hell do I have to go through this?
Damn it!
This pain in my heart...
You're going to make up for this
by dying in disgrace! I'll see to that!
If Bucciarati and Trish won't turn back to normal unless I destroy you...
then I'll do it!
Go ahead and try it...
Go ahead and try it...
Damn it...
The only problem with auto-tracking is that it won't listen to me 100 percent.
You bastard!
You got me three times already.
I know the range of your attacks!
That bastard's range...
It's gotten taller?
It must've grown even more because it got pissed off!
Di molto!
I knew choosing that woman as the mother was the right choice!
Simple is best.
I'm going to kill this bastard exactly how I want to kill him!
Bring it back, Golden Wind!
Die!
Useless!
A direct hit.
You should get your eyes checked.
You didn't hit my head!
I've won! This is the end!
I told you, it's useless.
Wh-What the hell?!
Look again.
It's the bike.
Crush
This is nothing...
I'll just split apart and get away aga—
Think about it.
There's gasoline in bikes.
I'm pretty sure I can cause a big enough explosion to keep you from splitting apart
in time to escape.
What?!
om
Sizzling... Burning...
Looks like doing what you wanted was useless...
Burn burn burn burn burn burn burn...ing...!
I-It disappeared?
Damn it! This is unbelievable!
Curse you, newbie!
He did it.
It should be somewhere around here...
My car is gone!
Where's my car? Was it stolen?!
That's Melone's bike...
I was told to leave no stone unturned and
I get the "leave no stone unturned" part.
I mean, you have to turn stones over to find stuff.
But what the hell does it mean to take a leaf out of someone's book?!
What's a leaf doing inside a book?!
Damn it!
What's that supposed to mean?!
Why the hell is there a leaf in a book?!
You think I'm stupid?! Damn it!
Hey, Melone! Bucciarati and his crew are nowhere to be found!
Are you listening?! Hello?!
I hear you...
I still have Bucciarati's blood!
I can create an infinite number of Juniors!
I'll have them track Bucciarati down immediately!
You'd better, Melone.
We need to be extra careful with the newbie.
We should get rid of him first.
I'll find an even better mother
and create an even more powerful and invincible
Junior to go track them down.
What the hell was that?
What? What's wrong?
What's a snake doing at a station in Rome?
I-It's burning!
This is... that newbie's ability...
Hello?
The venomous snake I left at Roma Termini Station
reverted to being one of the enemy's components.
We disposed of the user.
there are only two members of the Hitman Team left.
Still, we can't let our guard down.
Let's haul ass to Venice!
Now Melone, too?
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit!
Hello?!
It's me. I've managed to get that thing analyzed.
Huh?!
I'm sending the data right now.
We've received a new order from the boss.
Abbacchio, could you come over here by this chair?
Me?
Here's the order.
"Have Abbacchio use his Moody Jazz near the chair and rewind 14 hours."
Someone was inside this turtle before we got here.
I think that's what this suggests.
Got it.
It transformed.
Hey, I've seen that geezer before!
That's the capo, Mr. Pericolo.
So he was the one who placed the turtle
And approximately 14 hours ago, he entered this turtle.
I'm continuing the replay.
Bucciarati and team, I will now give you your final order.
Final order?
The reason we're using this method to give you information is to prevent leaks.
I'm about to tell you something of utmost importance that no one else must learn:
how you're going to hand Trish over to the boss.
How we're going to...
...hand Trish over?
Well, here it is.
It contains the data on how you're going to hand her over.
Hey! He set it on fire!
Abbacchio, pause it!
Right.
I'm pretty sure this is the entrance to Venice...
Right in front of Santa Lucia Station.
That is all.
They've already found out about me.
The most important thing is to deliver Trish safely to her father.
We mustn't leave any kind of evidence.
Thanks to the boss, I was able to live a very wealthy, blessed, and fulfilling life.
My mission is now over.
I pray from the bottom of my heart that you stay safe.
What the hell?!
Mr. Pericolo...
They should've received the order by now.
Obtain the disc, or getting to me is going to prove rather difficult.
The most important thing is what awaits at the end...
Bring my daughter Trish here...
to Venice.
The marine fortress city on the water, visible in the morning haze: Venice.
There is only one road by which one can travel there from the mainland by car:
the Ponte della Libertà, which stretches for a length of 3.5 kilometers over a shallow ocean.
The station lies just beyond the bridge.
The lion statue where the disc is hidden can be found in a square there.
Giorno, there's no one tailing us so far.
Yes. There's no one coming from the front, either.
We're the only car on this road.
Why do the windows keep fogging up so quickly?
Ow!
What the hell?!
I apologize.
On a straight bridge like this?
Be more careful, damn it! Do you even have a license?
No. I'm only fifteen.
What's that thing stuck on the window?
It's on the inside.
No, wait...
That shape...
Let's open the windows a bit.
It's morning, so the different temperatures inside and outside the car are fogging them up.
Wh-What?! What's with this wind?
At first, we were scared frozen... But...
With the help of a computer, it wasn't too hard to recreate
You guys are naïve!
There's no way you can get away from the Hitman Team!
An enemy?! They somehow got onto the roof of the car!
Mista, what are you doing?! Shoot the roof!
This car is being frozen at an insane speed.
It's so cold that my finger got stuck to the window
If I don't peel my face off of it, my brain's gonna freeze up.
But I'm not sure if I want to sacrifice my face, either...
Where's the turtle?
You two aren't with Trish and Bucciarati?
If you're actually bothering to split up...
That means you must be on a mission to get something extremely important.
The location in the picture...
Blood finally spurted from my hand!
Yeehaw!
Bonk
I-Ice!
The guy's encased himself in ice and froze himself to the roof of the car!
The bullets can't get through to him!
What's wrong?
C-Crap! We're starting to freeze, too!
Save me!
Number Two!
Don't go!
Number Two! Number Three!
Fwooooo
What?!
A-All I did was blink... and now my eyelashes are stuck together!
He must've waited for this to happen before getting on the roof...
This car is currently going 80 kilometers per hour.
Which means...
so we're currently freezing at -20° Celsius.
Then stop the damn car!
Why the hell are you still flooring it?!
Yes. I've been trying to stop it.
But the brake pedal is frozen and won't go down!
I'm losing the steering wheel, too.
The surface of the car has reached -100° Celsius for sure!
Th-The blood that was spurting out of my hand froze...
The moisture from my breathing caused my nostrils to freeze together...
And now, my lips...
Shit! I can't breathe!
S-Stop the car, Giorno!
You can turn the car into a frog or something, can't you?!
Do something with your ability!
I've already tried that, as well.
But there are no organisms that can be born at -100° Celsius!
You know Paris, France? In English, they pronounce it "Paris,"
but everyone else pronounces it without the "s" sound, like the French do.
But with Venezia, everyone pronounces it the English way, "Venice."
Like ...
Why, though?! Why isn't the title ?!
k
Are you friggin' mocking me?!
That shit pisses me off!
Bunch of dumbasses!
Looks like it's finally becoming a bit difficult to drive.
Mista...
So sadly, all I'm really useful for right now...
is picking up bullets.
You won't be able to fill the car with any more holes.
I'll just freeze you to an even lower tem—
When you fire bullets, they heat up, don't they?
So when I fire the bullets that Giorno picked up for me...
It creates heat!
I guess I'll go ahead and shout this for Giorno, while I'm at it...
Golden Wind!
We did it!
Keep hold of the steering wheel, Giorno!
k
Tch.
But you're not getting away!
Seriously? That bastard!
He's still coming after us!
I'm gonna be the one who gets his hands on whatever's at the station, no matter what.
You're wasting your bullets.
which I then wear like armor.
Go faster, Giorno!
I can't go any faster!
Even worse, they found out about the station!
so depending on how you look at it, that's kind of a bright side.
You're always so optimistic, aren't you?
You're very unusual.
He's coming! Floor it! Faster!
I told you, I can't!
If we slip, we're going to lose even more spee—
Just do it, damn it! I said floor it, so floor it!
I told you! This is useless!
Number Three and Number Two up on the roof, come back!
I hope you get to share a hot, passionate kiss with the road.
Your face will be well-acquainted with it at the speed you're going.
Yeah!
Good. We managed to lose him.
Before he can catch up to us, we're going to get our hands on the thing and hide!
You're not getting away!
He's freezing the moisture from the car's exhaust!
What kind of temperature do you have to freeze it at to do this shit?
You bastard! Eat lead again!
He opened the trunk! Which means...
Sh-Shit! He got into the trunk! Stop the car, Giorno!
He's gonna freeze the brake pedal so it'll be useless again!
There's no need for that...
Seeing as Trish isn't here, this is what I was planning to do in the first place.
Shatter—
G-Giorno!
It only cracked?
How can I destroy this armor?
Giorno! Get away from him!
No! Not yet!
We made it to Venice!
I'm diving into the canal!
Episodio 19 White Ice
We made it to Venice!
I'm diving into the canal!
Mista! Please hurry up and get out of the car!
G-Giorno! You... Your body's already...
but our priority is to obtain the item.
Getting that thing will lead to our victory.
The disc is in there!
We're surrounded by water, so it'll take a while for it to freeze.
That's why I drove into the canal.
Don't worry about me! Hurry and get out!
Got it, Giorno. But I don't like your idea of victory!
Killing him, and the both of us living to retrieve that thing...
That'll be our victory!
Like hell I'm gonna let you get away!
Just try and jump in, Mista!
I don't mind making a wager on whether or not you can swim faster than my ice!
Sh-Shit! Driving into the canal was a bad idea!
This guy has no weak point when it comes to ice!
Episodio 19 White Ice
Turn the car into a plant, Giorno!
The hood of the car hasn't completely frozen over yet.
Nurture a plant to life while you still can!
You're trying to grow vines to use them as ropes?
That's not happening!
I-It's no use.
Who said anything about growing vines that reach the bank, Giorno?
This is perfectly fine!
But I need more! More! More!
If you don't want to die, get me more!
If you don't grow more, we're gonna die, Giorno!
Gotcha! Too bad you couldn't grow it to the bank of the canal!
Well done, Giorno! It froze over!
Th-That bastard! He froze some short grass to create a sled?
N-No... A snowboard!
Damn it!
He's not going to let me get away so easily.
Of course not...
White Ice! Undo the ice temporarily!
Th-Th ice...
...melted!
Mista!
An extremely low temperature is a world of life or death!
Nothing can move in extremely low temperatures!
They can stop everything!
That's what makes my White Ice perfect!
It can even stop the raging ocean if I want it to!
Hurry and get up on the bank, Mista!
Mista!
Gather up the grass that's floating in the water!
The grass you were using as a snowboard!
While you can fire the gun in your right hand!
Give it up, Mista!
Do you still not understand that attacking me is pointless?!
ab
Gathering up grass... I see.
Giorno, if you release your ability, the short grass turns back into car parts.
Therefore, we can shoot them into you!
What?!
D-Did that do it?
No, it's shallow.
but Mista, this just bought us some time!
Let's get the thing quickly, then get out of here fast.
That same strategy won't work again the next time he catches up.
Please go, Mista!
The disc will show up somewhere if we destroy the lion statue.
I'll retrieve it, then hide somewhere in the city.
If I have a few dozen seconds, I can do this.
But will hiding be enough to get away from that guy?
It might just work, but it might not.
More importantly, this guy's way too dangerous.
It'll be even worse if he ends up running into Bucciarati and the others.
We need to end him now!
This is our only chance!
Wha— Mista! What are you doing?!
Your ability is perfect? That's impossible!
If you've completely encased yourself in ice, how are you able to breathe?
There it is. I knew it.
He's breathing from there, the back of his neck.
Take your positions, Six Bullets!
Number One and Number Two, go around and flank him!
Wah, he's looking over here!
He's gonna do another ice attack!
No, first, he's probably going to go up for air.
Once he rises to the surface, I'm gonna put a bullet in his head!
He's trying to go up to the surface!
Let's go, Bullets!
Mista!
It must be due to his posture! He's facing up right now!
Sh-Shit! Let's scram!
Oh, shut up!
How dare you do that to my forehead?!
Mista!
What the?!
What the hell are you trying to do?!
He looked down! We can see it!
It's the hole! Now!
Here it comes!
We can do this!
Gwooom
We did it! Bullseye!
Th-That sound...
That sound... It can't be!
So you found my breathing hole and went after that...
Mista!
But extremely low temperatures stop everything!
Gases turn to liquids, and liquids turn to solids!
Take a closer look. Can't you see the air that's stopped?
The bullet, Mista!
What?!
White Ice... Gently Weeps!
Mista!
I'd already created a wall of frozen air!
Anything that comes near me will stop!
This is a lesson I learned from you, Mista!
Giorno was right.
This is all my fault... This is my responsibility.
If only I'd prioritized getting that thing...
It's not under any trash cans or benches.
Where is it? This photo should be a hint...
Shit. This is the worst possible scenario.
Mista's currently acting out of despair.
He's decided to take responsibility for this, even if it costs him his life.
But the only ones who can open up a path
Things are getting interesting.
will open up a path in the darkness!
Ghiaccio
White Ice
What the hell is this?
In one of the cuts or gaps in the statue?
If I can just get close enough to aim through the wall of air...
Mista's getting reckless.
But this isn't just determination resulting from him being cornered.
We need resolve right now!
Resolve doesn't mean sacrifice!
A computer disc!
I knew it! The thing you were trying to get was something to tell you
I did it! Now we can find out who the boss really is!
All that's left now... is Trish!
Right after I finish you bastards off!
Come at me with all your futile attempts!
Mista!
What the hell are you doing?!
Having resolve is the ability to open up a path
Guido Mista: arrested at 17 for murder.
The result of the trial:
and he was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison.
My happy-go-lucky youth...
but in this moment, he didn't know what to do.
Damn it.
Get up. You're being released.
You're the one who bailed me out?
Yes. I saw the incident on the news and decided you acted out of self-defense.
It means you are incredibly skilled with a pistol and full of life.
But a guy like you probably wouldn't last two years in prison.
That's why...
You pulled some strings.
Do you belong to some organization?
Come with me.
I like the way you eat.
The bruschetta here is great, too. Do you still have some room?
Yeah.
Pardon me.
Yes, sir?
Could I get some bruschetta for him... I should get some for them, too.
Could I get four orders of bruschetta?
No, make that five. I guess I'll get an order for myself.
Right away, sir.
So, continuing our conversation...
I'm in.
I think you and I will get along great.
So, I'm in.
On one condition, though.
Treat me to some dolce, too.
Does this place have strawberry cake?
You sure are an odd one.
I guess this must be fate, too.
This isn't so bad. Everything worked out in the end.
Mista learned that people have predetermined destinies.
but they ultimately end up traveling the path they were destined to walk.
I can see it! I can see the path perfectly!
I can see it for sure this time!
It's there, Giorno!
Yeehaw!
oom
Bam
Bam
nk
Crack
Crack
You guys don't seem to understand.
The air is frozen because of the extremely low temperature.
Just like this.
the air turns back to normal!
If I take it in like this...
The hole!
He deflected the bullets!
Six of them! O-Oh, no!
I hope you have the resolve for this, Mista!
It's over.
Yeah, my resolve is there, Giorno.
The path toward the resolve to be willingly shot by my own bullets...
I-I can't see!
The path through the darkness
I-It was to splash your face with my blood!
Shit! I can't get it off!
Hey, the metal pole from earlier!
Mista, your bullet carved it into a—
Ow! That hurts!
Something... Something... Something... Something lukewarm is—
You asked me if I had the resolve for this...
Well, let me show you!
But you'll have to show me some resolve, too.
The resolve to be filled with holes and depart for the next world!
Th-That bastard's still standing!
He's hell-bent on shoving me back even farther!
Is he insane?! He's determined to finish this!
Shit! I need to get this out of my neck!
You're crazy! The bullet's gonna come flying back!
You're not gonna last!
I have to make it through.
Steel yourselves, Bullets!
White Ice... Gently Weeps!
Y-You can't take any more, Mista!
You're going to lose consciousness!
We're also...
...going to disappear!
N-Not yet!
Y-You did it!
It went all the way in!
You're... wrong...
The one with stronger resolve... is me...
Guido Mista...
I'll commend you for... pushing me this far...
But the one who took better advantage of all the spurting blood... was me!
I froze the blood that spurted out of my neck to support me!
Now my neck won't get pushed farther onto the spike!
The spike won't go any farther in!
Also... Haven't you forgotten something?
The bullet you shot last is still...
Straight into your head!
I win!
There's no wound?!
Wha—
Mista...
even brighter than this rising sun.
And it's shining on the path...
that we're meant to take!
What the hell?!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Recently, I... started noticing...
that despite Giorno Giovanna...
being a newbie...
things always seem...
The resolve I showed just now was also partly Giorno's.
It was making its way into my heart before I even realized it.
and he kept me moving.
What the hell is his deal?
Well, I guess that doesn't matter right now.
It's not my style to think too much about stuff.
Mista, we safely retrieved the disc, thanks to you.
Hurry and fix me up. I-I can't breathe...
I wouldn't have been able to show that resolve without your ability.
Hurry and fix me up, before I actually die...
Of course. But I'd like to clear something up first.
Golden Wind doesn't exactly fix things.
I'll give life to the bullets embedded in your body
and plug up the arteries and other parts that were destroyed.
Just shut up and do it already.
Since I'm not exactly healing you, your pain will remain.
Please don't complain to me later.
Ow!
O-Ow! Be more gentle! Be more gentle, damn it, Giorno!
I told you, I can't.
You're a gangster, for crying out loud. Please quit fussing.
Bucciarati! I'm picking up two signals...
Proceed, but carefully.
I'm assuming it's Mista and Giorno.
I'm sure they're bored out of their minds waiting for us since nothing's happening.
Ack! Giorno!
There they are! Hey, Mista! Gio—
Be gentler! Gentler, damn it!
Don't take off my clothes! I'll feel it more!
Well, Narancia? Did you find those two?
Huh? W-Well, u-um...
No! Huh?! Suddenly there's something in my eye?
Giorno, no! Don't! N-No more! I-I can't!
I can't see! I can't see them clearly!
Be gentler, damn it!
Risotto's whereabouts are unknown. Currently searching airports, train stations, and the area around Naples.
Curse you, Risotto...
You must be heading to Venice.
If Bucciarati and his crew put an end to you, that's fine.
Regardless, I'm not worried.
Episodio 20 The Final Mission from the Boss
The Final Mission from the Boss
How much longer till we get there?
We're almost at Rialto Bridge.
It'll be at least another five minutes.
All right. Keep going.
Bucciarati, what was the mission from the boss?
I'm reconfirming the mission from the boss right now.
Are you all safe? I thank you for protecting my daughter Trish from the bottom of my heart.
I'll read it aloud.
"The information on this disc
Therefore, I'd like to warn you that I have no way of knowing
or how many members you've lost at this point in time.
and also your final mission.
Let me also warn you that, should you deviate even in the slightest
from the instructions on this disc, it will be unforgivable.
I will consider it a warning that you mean to harm me.
Here is your final mission.
You will now head to
the island of San Giorgio Maggiore.
The place you will take my daughter is
your mission will be over.
Instruction one: there are no stairs to the top of the tower.
Currently, there is only one elevator that goes to the top.
The only ones allowed in the elevator are Trish and one bodyguard.
Instruction two: the bodyguard is prohibited
Instruction three: you must land on the island within
fifteen minutes of retrieving this disc.
There is a tracking device in the disc, so I know where you are.
Instruction four: the rest of you will wait on the boat.
That's all of it.
Bucciarati, we have arrived.
So the boss is at the top of that tower right now...
Those are pretty detailed instructions. He seems extremely cautious.
But I guess you couldn't be a mafia boss otherwise.
Anyway, this means our mission ends here.
We all made it out alive, so I guess all's well that ends well.
Yeah, just barely, though.
Let's live it up in Venice for a few days before we go home.
I hear the food's great there.
They have good food here?
What kind of food do they have?
and I hear the carpaccio at the Hotel Cipriani is fantastic.
Hey, you bastards!
Don't let your guard down!
The mission's not over yet!
Narancia, keep an eye on the radar.
S-Sure.
I'll take her to the top of the bell tower.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Bucciarati's the capo, so of course he's going to take her, you dumbass!
The boss didn't specify anyone because he didn't know who was still alive!
Of course. I'll go.
All right, Trish.
I know.
I'll find him, no matter what.
Ladybugs are considered sun bugs.
They're symbols of life, right?
They're good luck charms, right?
Oh, that's right.
Yes. Ladybugs bring good luck.
This brooch that's been given life with Golden Wind's ability will act as a tracking device.
Bucciarati.
What is it, Fugo?
I thought this was a good opportunity to say this.
Why so formal? What is it?
and I know you'll be able to complete this mission.
Of course he can.
Let's aim for an even higher position in the organization!
Yeah... You're right.
Let's go, Trish.
Giorno will be able to track him down.
Right now, we just need to find out who he is...
No matter what.
The elevator door is open.
There are only two buttons, for the first floor and the roof.
It goes directly to either. There are no other floors to stop on.
What's...
What's going to happen to me?
and now, I'm going to be taken to a father I don't even know or love...
Where am I going to go now?
The boss is just concerned for your safety.
this is what I think...
First, you'll be given a different name.
You might even need to have plastic surgery.
You'll be given a new identification and family registry.
some far-off country, where you'll live happily.
Your father has that kind of power.
Here. Let me give you a hand.
It's not like...
I-I'm nervous or anything...
I wonder...
if I'll be able to like my father.
No family worries about that.
Yeah...
It's strange to even worry about that.
We're almost to the top.
Trish? Tri—
Wh-What?!
Trish... No... What's—
Trish and I should be the only ones here.
No one other than the guys on my team knows we're...
No... It can't be!
Could the boss...
In order to make sure he stays completely invisible...
Did he have us protect his daughter
in order to ensure that he could finish off his daughter himself?!
Bruno Bucciarati was born as a fisherman's son in a suburb of Naples.
but he was an earnest and honest fisherman
who tried to protect his family from the cruelties of this world.
Bruno.
Dad.
You need me to fix the net?
His mother was very kind, and Bruno loved his conversations with her.
He always looked forward to the bedtime stories she read to him before going to sleep.
All right, go to sleep, now.
But...
It occurred when Bucciarati was seven.
So what are you going to do now?
Well... I want a change, so I'm going to leave this town.
After ten years of marriage, his parents divorced.
As for the reason, only his parents would know the answer to that.
What are we going to do about Bruno?
After a discussion, Bruno's parents had him make a decision.
but we're going to be living separately now.
Who do you want to live with? Me or your father?
We want you to decide.
You want to leave this place with me and go to the city, right?
You're very smart.
There'll be a lot more kids your age, too!
So, you want to live with your mother, right?
You'll come with me, right?
I'll...
Huh?!
What?! Bruno, you should really think about this!
You like me better, don't you?
I'll stay here with Dad.
No...
Mom's strong...
But...
All right, I'm leaving.
I'll come back once a month to visit.
Okay.
two years after his mother left, she remarried a man from Milan.
He would end up only seeing his mother at Christmas after that.
he became determined to send Bucciarati to a good school.
Dad, I think customers are going to come by soon.
Oh, I guess it's about that time...
I'll reapply the nets.
All right. I'll let you handle this.
he started taking tourists and other fishermen on his boat.
And the wheel of fate continued to turn.
Sirs, that island isn't good for fishing.
There are better—
Whatever, man.
We wanna go fishing over there.
Just shut up and take us.
Got it?
R-Right...
his body riddled with bullet holes.
He's been shot seven times in his arms, shoulders, chest, and torso.
We got an operating room open!
Dad! Dad!
There are bullets still in his body.
Dad!
For now, please just wait until the surgery's finished.
Be strong. Can you give us contact information for the rest of your family?
Dad...
Forensics is coming by later, so give them this as evidence.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
Right.
H-How did this happen?
Good evening. Are you his son?
We found this at the scene.
Apparently, your father witnessed a drug deal.
He was shot so that he wouldn't talk.
Your father is a very important witness.
I'm sure he'll be okay.
My father was shot because of something like that?
Luckily, Bucciarati's father survived.
and the boat that found and rescued him
He was graced by good luck all around.
But in terms of Bucciarati's life, it might've been better if his father had died.
There are certain sticky situations where you don't
Fishermen have way too much energy, damn it.
I'll keep watch! Just hurry up and do it!
You've got some nerve, making us come here so late at night.
Go to hell already!
Wh-Who the hell are you?
A k-kid? H-Hey!
What are you doing under the bed?!
I-It's just a kid! Just take the knife from him!
Riiiiip
Wh-What are you—
I'll protect you, Dad.
Don't worry. Take your time getting better.
At the age of twelve, Bruno Bucciarati committed murder
and entered a territory no one should set foot in.
I can't turn back now.
They'll keep trying to get revenge and shut us up.
I can't trust the police, either.
The only one willing to protect this father and son
was the organization that ran the city from the shadows.
they guaranteed their safety.
he worked hard there.
Five years later, Bucciarati's father died due to complications from his wounds.
Bucciarati loathed the white powder of greed that had
and swore that he would never forgive it.
But...
I-I'm sorry! I won't bother them again!
Good. You can't regret anything once you're dead, after all.
If you're also a gang member—
Those are...
Hey! What the hell are those?!
was involved in dealing the drugs he hated so much.
In this city?
And now...
The most repulsive form of evil is
and to use others merely for one's own gain!
This is unforgivable!
There... Trish is still alive.
All right. It's on him.
But, damn it, I can't see his face.
but the plan's changed.
I'm going to get rid of you right now!
It will be...
an assassination.
I'll get ahead of the boss on his escape route and finish him there.
This...
This hole...
I see.
he'll go through there and exit the other side of the building.
I managed to get here first.
Here he comes.
He came down the stairs!
Now!
Zipper Man!
I-It's going to break off!
So he knew I was after him...
I'd like to ask you why.
What's the meaning of this?
I highly respected all the work you'd done for me on this mission.
Were you so happy to become a capo that you got greedy?
Trish?
What about Trish?
My daughter has nothing to do with you.
You could never understand my true feelings!
Giorno?
Bucciarati! Yes, I know he's on the move.
I know exactly where the boss is because of the brooch you put on him.
Right now, he's at the bottom of the stairs to the charnel house.
He's right by the pillar that's about two meters away from the stairs.
But wait, Bucciarati!
You're there!
Take this! Zipper Man!
The one who was in the pillar's shadow...
was me!
Wh-What...
What's going o—
I decided to show you... as a parting gift.
Since this is the end, I'll fill you in.
What you just witnessed and felt
was you in the future.
You from a few seconds from the past witnessed yourself in the future.
This is my Emperor Crimson's ability.
I erased time and leapt past it.
I don't care who it is.
no matter what.
And now, you're going to have to disappear.
Bucciarati, your mission to act as Trish's bodyguard
has now come to an end.
Episodio 21 The Mystery of Emperor Crimson
The Mystery of Emperor Crimson
Damn it, Narancia!
Give them back!
Narancia, I swear...
There are only three left!
What a greedy little shit.
We've all been waiting for these, and we're hungry!
The ladybug brooch is moving from the top of the tower.
I can feel it.
to try to cross through there.
Bucciarati must've put the brooch somewhere on the boss's clothes.
Sorry, Giorno, but could you grab that water?
I'm a bit thirsty.
Also, you should be careful.
and not set foot on the island.
Right.
Huh? Eh?
Y-You ate them, didn't you, Mista?!
Give them back, damn it!
And what the hell do you have on your mouth?
Huh?
Ah!
"Ah," my ass! You little shit!
S-So sweet!
When did you stuff them in your mouth?
By the way, I didn't thank you yet, did I, Giorno?
For grabbing the water.
Something's... bizarre...
but something's strange.
Hey, you bastard!
Didn't you hear that the boss ordered us not to set foot on the is—
...land?
Huh?!
This isn't normal.
Something weird is going on!
This isn't good! Bucciarati!
Where do you think you're going, Giorno?!
Is that you, Giorno?
Bucciarati!
I know exactly where the boss is because of the brooch you put on him.
Right now, he's at the bottom of the stairs to the charnel house.
He's right by the pillar that's about two meters away from the stairs.
But wait, Bucciarati!
Something is wrong!
Bucciarati, your mission to act as Trish's bodyguard
has now come to an end.
Wh-Why, you...
He's trying to immobilize my arm.
Zipper Man!
But... Emperor Crimson has already...
...seen through it.
Your movements in the future.
The trajectory of your movements in the future.
and no one remembers the movements they made within this segment of time.
The clouds in the sky don't realize they've broken apart.
A flame that's extinguished doesn't even realize the moment it went out.
All that remains in this world are the results.
In the world where time has been eliminated, all movement becomes pointless!
I am the only one who can react to these movements.
I can see every single one of your movements!
This is Emperor Crimson's ability!
Th-This ability...
You succeed, and you fail.
But if you happen to find the pitfall known as the future that's right in front of you
you will never experience a setback in your life.
You will remain in your best condition.
Don't you think so?
Now that I've actually met you, I can tell that we are indeed related.
I can sense that you are, without a doubt, my daughter.
Which means...
When you are awake, you will feel the exact same way toward me!
Trish...
I must fill any pitfall that threatens my path!
I will now sever this bond of blood that binds us!
Trish!
Dogyuuuuun
Dogyuuuuun
Wh-What?!
That must be Giorno...
Giorno's Golden Wind's ability...
and a turtle with Stand abilities was born.
Since our call was interrupted, he must've sensed something was wrong
and activated his ability.
He always gives me courage...
I didn't think I could move anymore, but... Not yet.
I still...
have to keep moving a little bit more.
My mission's done? You're wrong, Boss.
It's still ongoing!
As for Trish...
I will protect her on my own order!
then his ability surpasses all others in its invincibility.
But...
This ability doesn't allow him to read one's movements for long!
It's only a short time.
It seems to be around five to ten seconds.
Distance...
For now, I need to get as far away as possible!
I need to get far enough that the boss can't find Trish!
I beg of you to keep moving, body.
Don't let me waste this chance that Giorno gave me!
Until I can get out of this basement...
It seems there was another traitor.
Must be the newbie.
Rumble
If my information is correct, I believe his name is Giorno Giovanna.
Rumble
So he must've joined this organization with the intent to betray me from the start.
but it's nothing for me to escape that turtle an instant sooner.
It appears that your efforts were futile, Bucciarati.
How are you still able to move?
but you'll be able to die peacefully.
First, I'm going to eliminate Trish.
Don't you dare move, Bucciarati!
The chance that Giorno gave me wasn't in vain!
I've already read yours!
I knew before you fell into the sewer
that you'd probably use your ability to escape!
Now, Zipper Man!
Emperor Crimson!
That was close...
Take this!
It wasn't you that I was trying to attack!
It was this pillar!
Zipper, close!
What?!
As I thought... Your ability is invincible...
But it appears that you can only read movements for a short time.
You're not reading ahead of time.
Just try and read my future movements, Boss.
Try to figure out what I'm going to do in a few seconds.
Try to see beyond time.
You should be able to see me
Bucciarati! Trish!
This wound...
What happened in the basement?!
Where's the boss?
He should still be around...
I don't know the whole situation, but there's no way
Bucciarati...
N-No...
Bucciarati!
His pulse...
I-Impossible! It's gone!
I created the parts needed for his recovery!
Bucciarati, please breathe!
So this must be Giorno Giovanna.
His unknown ability gave Bucciarati the chance to escape.
However...
I will not let them get away!
This is impossible!
There's no way he shouldn't have a heartbeat!
Giorno, it's me.
Call Abbacchio and the others.
That voice...
I told you to call Abbacchio and the others.
Get out of here!
Out of this church!
B-Bucciarati!
Th-Thank goodness!
Hurry! Hurry up and call the others!
B-But...
We can't figure out who the boss actually is right now.
We need to get out of here, Giorno! While we're still far enough from him!
They're within my range!
I'll explain later! Hurry up, Giorno!
Golden Wind!
Giorno's over there!
Hey, Giorno, you bastard! Come back here!
How are you gonna make up for disobeying orders and stepping onto the island?!
Bucciarati's here, too!
H-How the hell did you get so injured?!
Why do you still have Trish with you?!
What's going on here, Bucciarati?
I'll explain everything later.
Right now, we need to get out of here as fast as we can.
I commend you, Bucciarati.
I commend your precise and keen decision making.
But this is not the end.
I will never...
let you escape
from Venice!
Now I understand why the boss is feared by everyone and how he ruled over all of us.
We can't defeat the boss... not now.
As for his identity...
we'll need to find his ability's weakness first!
Emperor Crimson
What...
What the hell's going on, Bucciarati?
We need an explanation.
All right. I'll just come out and say it.
The reason I brought Trish back
is because I betrayed the boss just now.
I'll be leaving you guys now.
If you go with me, you will also become traitors.
Wh-What?
I-I don't think I heard you right...
He said... he betrayed the boss.
B-But why?
because you guys have nothing to do with this.
I think you should explain.
Some of them might want to follow you.
We need people on our side.
What the hell is your deal, Giorno?!
Bucciarati!
What's wrong? Are you all right?
I'm fine.
That shouldn't be possible...
Did I miss a wound?
I guess I've used up a good deal of energy.
Does he not feel pain? There was no blood coming from the wound, either.
Was I just seeing things?
I'm sorry.
You had me worried for a sec!
For real.
Bucciarati, please...
Yeah, Bucciarati.
The boss had us act as her bodyguards
so that he could kill his daughter with his own two hands.
Because she shares his blood, she could have figured out his true identity.
I found that out and...
I couldn't forgive him.
I couldn't just come back pretending I didn't see that.
That's why I betrayed him!
How could you?
Are you insane, Bucciarati?
no matter who it is.
Hell, Venice could already be surrounded by the boss's elite guard!
You're right, and that's why I'm going to need help.
come down these stairs and get on the boat.
But I will not order any of you to come with me.
I won't even ask you to come with me.
I did this all on my own.
So you don't need to feel obligated to come with me.
This may come off as arrogant, but I'm going to say it anyway.
I did this because I believe I'm right.
I have no regrets.
Despite the world we live in, I want to continue on the path that I believe in.
If we can just find his weakness...
I will defeat the boss, no matter what.
I will find his weakness, no matter what!
I understand your reasons, and what you did was right, Bucciarati.
But I'm going to be blunt...
I hate to say it, but no one's going to get on that boat.
How could you let your emotions take over like that?
I owe you my life, but going with you now would be a different matter.
You've lost sight of reality.
No one can survive in this world on expectations alone.
We can't survive without the organization.
Fugo's absolutely right.
What you did is basically suicide.
Besides, I pledged my loyalty to the organization.
It's not like I pledged my loyalty to you.
That being said...
I never had a home or place I wanted to go.
The only time I'm ever at ease
is when I'm with you, Bucciarati.
Abbacchio...
Y-You can't be serious, Abbacchio!
If we actually manage to defeat the boss...
I'd say I'm next in line to become a capo.
Bucciarati's smart.
He never goes into a fight that he has no chance of winning.
We're gonna strike it rich for sure.
Mista! Not you, too!
What are you going to do, Fugo?
You've all l-lost your minds!
We're going to be completely isolated!
Where are you going to run to?
I-I... d-don't know what to do...
Tell me, Bucciarati...
What should I do?
Do you think I should go?
Are you scared?
Yeah... I'm r-really scared...
B-But just order me!
If you order me to go with you, I'll be more confident!
Nothing scares me, as long as you order me to do it!
No.
This is one thing I can't order you to do. You need to decide for yourself.
You need to choose your own path.
B-But I don't know what to do! I don't know!
But let me just give you this warning.
Don't come with me, Narancia.
You're not cut out for this.
Are you serious about this?
You'll be killed, without a doubt.
There are some things in this world that you just can't do, even if you're right.
Our job has always been dirty.
How is this any different?
Even then... I can't lie to myself.
Let's go!
Why? You're insane!
All this for a woman you just met and barely talked to!
You don't even know what kind of music she likes!
Trish was abandoned by the people she trusted...
I was also abandoned before.
I was abandoned by my dad and the friends I trusted.
We're sort of alike...
It's none of our business what the boss does with his daughter!
Trish and I are sort of alike!
All he had to do was close his eyes! I just don't understand!
Giorno, give me the turtle.
Let's put Trish inside it.
Okay.
Bucciarati, please turn around.
Bucciarati!
I'll go! I'll go, too! I'm coming with you!
Don't order me not to go with you!
Trish is me! She's me! The wound on her arm is my own!
Narancia... Not you, too...
You fool... You're going to be killed.
I can't go along with such a foolish betrayal.
I can't become a righteous idiot...
You took way too long to make your decision.
You'd better not hold this against us later on.
Narancia, I have nothing but respect for your courage.
I guess Fugo didn't come after all.
That was his choice to make.
Bucciarati!
I'll defeat the boss with you!
Yeah.
Squalo?
The names of the traitors are Bruno Bucciarati and Giorno Giovanna.
The boss's identity: Unknown Stand name: Emperor Crimson Has the ability to eliminate a certain amount of time. Because of this, he can predict the future. Invincible.
They can be taken dead or alive.
Special Program Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind determinazione
It doesn't look like anyone's following us.
Bucciarati, are we not leaving Venice?
The boss has his own personal elite guards.
I'm sure they've already learned of our betrayal.
They're probably... going to be coming after us next.
But we don't know what kind of abilities they have.
they might strike us there.
Let's wait and see for now.
Understood.
Mista!
We're hungry!
I'm starving!
Feed us!
Our guts are running on empty!
Calm the hell down!
but could we stop by a restaurant or something?
Well...
I guess we need to refill our guts, as well.
Episodio 22 The "G" in Guts
You guys have heard of vegetarians, right?
Are they allowed to eat, like, cheese?
Probably not.
I mean, milk and eggs come from cows and chickens.
That means they probably can't have cake that uses whipped cream, either.
What?! They can't have cake, either?
I wonder if their bodies actually function better, then.
Then what do those guys do about shoes or handbags?
Those are made from leather.
they probably wear sneakers and carry backpacks instead.
Man, they're intense.
So would you have old ladies dressing like basketball players, then?
They'd never let them into a restaurant looking like that.
Giorno, being all scared won't make anything happen.
Let's just eat for now.
Yes, I know... Still, we need to be on our guard.
For example, there's a possibility someone could've poisoned our food.
Y-You bastard! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Huh?
What are you gonna do about this, you little shit?!
You think you can pay for this?! This suit cost four million lire!
Let's take this outside!
h
You must be an enemy!
What?!
You an enemy?! Huh?!
Well, are you?!
You an enemy?! Take that! And that!
Hold it, Narancia, Mista.
I don't think this guy's an enemy.
He's unconscious.
He's totally just a random civilian.
What? Are you serious?
Crap! What am I gonna do?
Yeah, this stain's gonna be hard to get out.
A single drop of wine on a white suit really stands out.
I can't pay for this shit!
Well, the location of the stain might make it look like a button.
If he puts a button there, he can hide it.
While we're at it, let's get him to make sure there isn't any poison in our food.
That's a great idea!
Hey, that's enough.
More importantly...
What's going on with Bucciarati right now?
After that battle with the boss, Bucciarati's heart definitely stopped.
And when he got hurt back there, there wasn't a single drop of blood.
What about now?
But right now isn't the best time to find out.
I'll keep this secret to myself for now.
So, Bucciarati, what are we going to do now?
and the boss is the only one who can move freely in that state.
He's invincible.
It doesn't matter who it is.
Anyone's attack becomes useless before that Stand.
However...
That'll change once we find out who the boss is!
we might be able to assassinate him.
And to do that, we need to find out
who he really is.
But how are we going to find him?
The boss is the type of guy who's gotten rid of any trace of himself.
Trish.
There must be some kind of hint involving Trish.
Everyone was after Trish, and the boss was trying to eliminate Trish.
Right?
A-About that...
I don't really want to involve Trish in this anymore...
Th-This feeling sucks.
Trish doesn't know anything!
If she finds out her actual father tried to kill her, she'll be in shock.
Bucciarati, please!
Let's not talk about the boss's identity and stuff like that in front of her.
There's no need for that, Narancia.
I've already known that... for a while.
T-Trish...
I remembered something when you said he got rid of any trace of himself.
My mother had mentioned that she met my father in Sardinia.
Sardinia...
When I was little, my mother told me
and he told her he'd be right back...
not even a photo or his name.
Before he became the boss of the organization...
Fifteen years ago...
Then was he born and raised in...
I'm not sure about all that, but...
Sardinia. His past and true identity should be in Sardinia.
Why are you telling us that?
We might end up killing your father!
No, we are determined to defeat him!
You defeating him or not isn't my problem.
But... I want to know!
I want to know who I came from!
I'm not about to die before I find that out!
Hey, Narancia.
Looks like she's way stronger than you thought.
Fine.
Sardinia...
That's our next destination after we escape from Venice.
That's where we'll find out who the boss really is.
but I guess she'd already made up her mind.
I just followed on a whim, so I still don't know
if there's any hope in this trip or not.
Huh?
An enemy! There's an enemy nearby!
There's a shark in my soup!
Li'l Bomber!
Giorno! Get Trish inside the turtle!
Abbacchio, cover the right! Mista, guard the left!
Where, Narancia? Where are they?
Inside the soup! They were somehow already in it!
Where are they now?
But they were there!
There was something like a shark in my soup!
I don't see anything strange about it.
Does that mean we lost them?
sh
Narancia!
What happened?!
Narancia! Were you attacked somewhere?
Where did they get you?
Narancia, what's wrong? What's there?!
I'm asking you what's wrong, Narancia!
Hold it, Mista. I don't think Narancia can talk...
What? You can't talk?
What's wrong, Narancia? What are you pointing at?
Water? You want a sip of water?
H-Hey! Th-This is bad! Look!
Narancia's tongue! It's gone!
On top of that, I don't think he's breathing!
This isn't good.
but it'll take time to finish.
Hey, come on! He's about to suffocate here!
Mista, do you have a pen?
A pen?! Y-Yeah, I have one...
Stab
Looks like he's breathing.
I'll give life to this pen to create parts for his tongue.
That way, he can breathe while I create his tongue.
I see...
So that's Giorno Giovanna.
Now I'm starting to understand the information the boss gave us.
We're going to have to be the most careful around that newbie kid.
Yeah... I'm a bit surprised he saved Narancia.
Tiziano.
As the boss's elite guards, we're going to have to defeat him here.
Are you ready, Squalo?
All according to plan.
As long as we can lure them to water, Crush is invincible.
Our plan will decide everything.
We'll take care of them one at a time, Tiziano.
Yeah, Squalo...
We'll use Narancia.
Crush
Squalo
Are you all right, Narancia?
Yeah...
You guys saved me.
What did you see?
How did the enemy Stand attack?
It... c-came from the soup...
Narancia, don't force it.
I-I'm fine. I can talk.
Hey, Narancia, what's the enemy like?
Where'd he run off to?
He was...
He was like a pebble!
He was huge, and he ran into the restaurant!
Huh? Huge like a pebble?
But earlier, you were saying it was in your soup!
You're contradicting yourself.
Huh? Did I just say that?
So, then... is the enemy about this big?
Nope.
Huh? No, wait!
Then, like, this big?
U-Um...
No? Then, like, this big?
Yup, exactly.
and it went running into the restaurant?
Yup.
Huh? What?
We can't get a clear picture of this enemy at all.
Does that mean it was really fast?
Nope! It was slow!
What?
Huh?!
If it was huge and slow, why didn't we see it?
Did you actually see a Stand?
Of course I did... n—
You keep contradicting yourself!
You're not trying to act tough because the enemy got you, are you?
I... I...
Answer me, damn it! You didn't actually see anything, did you?
Of course I did...
not...
So you didn't actually see anything, after all!
This is no time to screw around!
There's no one suspicious nearby.
Apparently, it's a remote-controlled Stand.
That must mean that the user is watching us from somewhere.
In that case, we should leave here immediately.
Let's follow the channel out to the sea.
Yeah, Giorno!
Let's do it! Let's use the channel!
Yes, Narancia. That's what I just...
Narancia?
Narancia, why do you keep covering your mouth?
Let me see it.
What the hell? It's completely normal.
Yup! I'm totally fine!
There's no problem at all, Mista!
So, what are we going to do, Bucciarati?
Are we going out to sea?
No. Let's not follow the channel just yet.
This is our chance.
We're going to use it to defeat that enemy!
which means there probably aren't that many members of his elite guard here.
I'm sure we'll be able to get through the seas of Venice just fine.
I see. You have a point. I agree.
Yeah, I agree.
Very well, Bucciarati.
If you say so.
Abbacchio, could you use your Moody Jazz to replay what happened?
Yeah, sure.
Where do you want to start?
From when the soup was still on the table?
Yeah.
What the hell, Narancia?
Guys! The enemy's right over there!
Over there? You mean inside the restaurant's bathroom?
Narancia, you damn well better have seen something this time!
Yup, I did!
After them. We'll settle things with this enemy here and now.
Come on, Giorno. Let's go.
Right...
Well done, Narancia.
None of his friends realize that there's another Stand
besides Crush, which travels from liquid to liquid.
Talking Mouth, is attached to your tongue and making you say
the exact opposite of what you mean.
All right, I'm gonna go kill the rest of them. Grazie.
g
S-So that's what was going on! Damn it!
They were using me to get everyone near the water, one by one.
How dare you underestimate me?!
I don't sense anyone here...
Let's at least figure out what the enemy looks like.
Moody Jazz!
Transform into whoever was in here a few dozen seconds ago, and pursue them!
Narancia!
but don't pursue them!
If it gets into water, they don't stand a chance!
In that case, I'll do everything I can to keep them away from water!
Over here...
Moody Jazz is transforming.
Water's bad news! Don't look in there!
Look at me! Look in here!
What the hell? That's disgusting!
Come over here, Abbacchio!
Look in here!
What are you talking about? Have you turned into some kind of pervert?
We're trying to investigate because you said you saw the enemy in here!
Did you really see them in here?
Of course, I—
Seriously, what is your problem?
Bucciarati, there's a chance Narancia was just seeing things in here.
We might be better off looking at the table if we want to pursue them.
Yeah.
Cut the crap, Narancia!
I'm not gonna let you take us all down!
Narancia, what happened to your finger?
Did you snag it somewhere?
Here, I'll stop the bleeding.
That bastard's going to try to use my blood to move.
N-No! S-Stay back, Giorno!
Yeah! Fix me right up, Giorno!
There's definitely something strange.
Is something wrong with the inside of your mouth?
They attacked your tongue earlier. Does that have anything to do with it?
Great job, Giorno! You're so intuitive.
Just a little more...
Just a little more, and Giorno will figure it out.
But you're bleeding really badly.
First, let's take care of that wound.
Now, let me see it.
No! You can't touch the blood!
Come on, Narancia.
This is bad! Stay back!
Hurry!
Li'l Bomber!
Damn it...
but there must be some reason you can't tell us the truth.
Yes! He figured it out!
Was there something left in your mouth from the first attack?
Like, an ability that makes you say the opposite of what you mean?
Yes! That's it, Giorno!
Sh-Shit! There's water from the pipe!
Giorno!
Episodio 23 Crush and Talking Mouth
None of his friends realize that there's another Stand.
Talking Mouth, is attached to your tongue and making you say
the exact opposite of what you mean.
there must be some reason you can't tell us the truth.
Giorno!
Giorno's getting pulled under!
Even though the water's so shallow!
Li'l Bomber!
The bastard is teleporting from liquid to liquid
despite there being so little water!
Yes! I got him.
it'll be a piece of cake to eliminate the rest of his friends one by one.
Yeah, it's all going according to plan.
But we should finish off Giorno immediately, Squalo.
Huh?
According to my information, Narancia's Li'l Bomber can track carbon dioxide.
if he's breathing, your Crush, which bit into him, will be tracked down.
Even if you jump from liquid to liquid.
It won't be good if Li'l Bomber tracks down your location and gets ahead.
It'll track us down.
All right, Tiziano.
I'll stop Giorno's breathing.
Right now.
Episodio 23 Crush and Talking Mouth
This isn't good.
I can't let them take Giorno away!
This enemy...
So there were already two Stands here?
the more I'm spreading the water around and giving them the upper hand!
I have to get ahead of them!
Where are they? Where'd they go?!
There!
I can fill them full of holes!
He's got his radar out.
As I figured, he's going to try to track us down and shoot us.
We should stop Giorno's breathing immediately.
Quit being so pushy. I know, Tiz.
But it sure is hard to attack Giorno while teleporting!
I got the timing down! Now!
Wha— Into his neck?!
Giorno! I-I didn't mean to shoot you!
Wh-What? His breathing...
The symbol indicating Giorno's breathing...
It disappeared from the radar!
Shit! They got away!
Excellent. Crush went into the sewers.
I'm just going to continue down into the canal and dispose of Giorno's body.
Hold it. What was that, Squalo?
I said I'd take his body to the canal and...
No, I'm talking about Narancia.
I almost didn't hear it, but he definitely said it!
He said, "They got away!" With his voice!
he should only be able to say the opposite of his intent.
But he said, "They got away!"
He even said the radar symbol disappeared.
Squalo! Move from there immediately!
What are you talking about, Tiziano?
Giorno's not breathing at all!
There's no one else who can track down my Crush!
He said, "They got away!" on purpose!
It was to put you at ease!
It was to stop Crush's teleportation for even a moment!
I don't know how, but he's definitely tracking you!
Back then, Giorno moved on purpose so I'd shoot him.
That way, there'd be residue from the gunshots, and I could actually track him!
I can see him.
I can see him clear as day!
Here we go! I'm gonna fill them with holes!
Here I come, you bastard!
This means Giorno's not dead yet!
If we can resuscitate him within a few minutes, he'll be saved!
This isn't good, Squalo!
he's going to go after the residue from your bullet wounds!
I did it! I got him out of the sewers!
It's no use, Bucciarati.
I can't replay this enemy any further.
I know for sure that they were in this cup on top of this table.
But they were only there for a moment.
From there, Moody Jazz can't transform, nor go forward.
What do you mean, Abbacchio?
I don't know. Maybe they can teleport.
But I don't have the answer.
The replay for this enemy...
It won't go any further, like a video tape that's been torn.
I can't believe Narancia would go this far...
No, it's Giorno.
This all happened because Giorno intentionally got shot
by Li'l Bomber's guns.
Shit! I can't get rid of the residue!
Even in the water!
Because the bullets were from a Stand.
I have to disappear somehow.
Somewhere he can't detect me!
I've been watching...
but it looks like it can't get very far in a single leap.
Looks to be about two to three meters!
Shit!
H-His attacks are becoming more precise!
It could be due to injuries, but their speed's getting slower!
Squalo!
Yes! Now I just need to end this with a finishing blow!
Take this, you fishy bastard!
Th-This smell...
There's a gas leak!
This is all according to plan, Narancia.
hot water spilled from the pot and extinguished the burner.
Now Li'l Bomber won't be able to shoot its guns!
Now you can't track me!
filling the room with carbon dioxide, and you won't be able to find me anymore!
Narancia, just go ahead and try to shoot
those guns!
We've won!
You know, if I can't shoot...
I have other ways of killing you!
Yes! I got the enemy!
Bucciarati! Mista! The enemy's here!
Abbacchio, the enemy's able to move from liquid to liquid!
Giorno's breathing again!
Huh?
Wait. What did I just say?
Why was I able to speak the truth?
just like you planned.
You're pretty badly injured, but I'm sure the boss will be satisfied.
Did you just yell something, Narancia?!
Did you say the enemy's over here?
But the release of Talking Mouth is only temporary.
Giorno's... That must be the enemy!
Wh-What?!
W-Wai—
We win, Squalo.
Yes... This is all according to plan!
Here we go, Six Bullets!
Shoot, Mista!
Wh-What?!
Sh-Shit! My radar!
I can't track them! They're going to attack!
Giorno's going to be taken because of my lie!
N-Narancia!
L-Look for it!
G-Giorno!
Don't go after the Stand...
Go after the user!
Giorno!
Hey, Narancia!
You bastard! Why'd you tell me to shoot?!
This room was filled with gas!
Look out! It's the enemy! The enemy's above!
No! Below! The enemy's below!
What?!
Guys!
It's no use! I can't stop myself from talking!
I have to stop talking!
It disappeared!
They're planning to eliminate Giorno before anyone else!
Don't go after the Stand...
Go after the user!
Giorno!
Giorno told me to find the user.
Right... They're hurt.
Because they're hurt, their breathing is probably labored.
So that's what he means.
He wants me to use my radar to find them.
I'm alone in this. I have to do this alone.
Someone who's breathing hard...
but they have to be somewhere around here.
There's no time! I have to be quick and find them!
Talking Mouth
Tiziano
Okay, this is all according to plan.
With Giorno gone, there's no one to fix their injuries.
Now, finish off Giorno.
For good.
Yeah, I'll do it.
but I have plenty of strength left to attack him.
Hey, look. It's Narancia.
What's he doing out here?
Where is Crush right now?
Over there.
It exited the restaurant's sewer pipe and is heading down the canal.
He shouldn't be able to track it anymore...
Don't tell me he's trying to find me instead!
My breathing...
Calm down, Squalo.
That's impossible.
He's just struggling because he's run out of options.
How many people do you think there are within hundred meters of here?
Fifty? A hundred?
There's no way he could tell you apart from the others.
But I'm injured.
If he's trying to find someone with labored breathing...
Don't panic, Squalo.
Look at the bottom of the stairs.
There are many with even more labored breathing than you in that square.
Calm yourself and your breathing.
If we hide your injuries and head into the square like nothing's wrong, we'll be safe.
We still win!
Yeah, you're right... You're exactly right.
There's no way he'd find us.
I found you!
You're right there!
Wh-What?!
Shit! I have to retrieve Crush!
Calm down, Squalo! Think this through!
He can only say the opposite of what he's thinking right now.
He said he found us, meaning he hasn't found us!
Don't forget that!
Then why did he bother saying that?!
He wants you to panic and make your breathing even more labored!
Please calm down. If you panic, it's exactly what he wants.
There's no way Narancia can single you out.
This is just his futile, last-ditch attempt.
Calm your breathing.
I found you...
There you are.
I finally... found you.
He said it again!
Please, calm down.
He hasn't found us. That's fact.
He's definitely lying!
My Talking Mouth is still definitely on his tongue...
H-Hey, look!
Wh-What?!
He cut out his own tongue!
With his own knife!
That's impossible!
let alone speak!
I found... you!
H-He has another tongue!
The ladybug became a tongue!
It can't be!
It's Giorno!
Giorno Giovanna!
Just as the boss had said, he's the biggest problem!
That bastard Giorno must've created a tongue
for Narancia in the kitchen and given it to him!
He's coming! He's heading this way!
So he was tracking my breathing!
It's the opposite!
If he was actually tracking you, he would've attacked already!
Considering the number of people out here, there's all kinds of breathing.
Labored breathing, slow breathing...
There's so much that I can't single anyone out.
But I've been waiting...
I've been waiting for this...
For the moment when someone's breathing drastically changes suddenly!
For someone to change their breathing drastically
after seeing me cut my tongue out with a knife!
For someone to see their Stand hanging out along with my tongue
and panic bigtime!
That's what I've been waiting for!
Just when I thought I'd lost you guys and was about to give up!
You, over there!
Your breathing just fluctuated, didn't it?!
Yeah, you! I'm talking to you!
I'm talking to you, long hair!
This can't be!
He actually cut out his tongue to track me!
Which must mean the shark user is the dude next to you!
He seems pretty damn pale.
Squalo, retrieve Crush!
I'm already on it!
It's traveling through the sewers and heading toward that well.
But... there's no water here!
There's no liquid that Crush can jump at Narancia from!
You must be him!
The guy who dragged Giorno away!
Tiziano!
Now you have some liquid... Squalo.
This didn't... go exactly according to plan...
But this doesn't change our victory.
We're still going to... win...
I don't give a damn about the boss's orders anymore.
I'm not going to kill you because I was ordered to as one of the elite guard.
Tiziano... I'm going to eliminate him for you!
I'll kill all of Narancia's friends, too!
I'll rip them to pieces and make them pay!
I'll make them all pay!
Crush! Rip out his throat!
Do you think... I'm going to falter?
Because of... Because of something like this?
We're...
completely safe and sound.
See ya...
Volare via.
"Go flying"
You're a damn traitor...
You're supposed to be eliminated by the boss...
You're supposed to have no choice but to fear your future...
What in the world is driving them forward?
Why does it seem like they have hope?
Wh-What could it...
Someone just collapsed!
Giorno!
Y-Yes! He's breathing again, faintly!
Giorno, wake up! Giorno! Giorno!
Narancia...
as though you're leading us...
We might actually have some hope for this journey... with you around.
Giorno, let's get back to everyone else.
How long has it been since the attack began?
Four to five minutes?
Anyway, it's hard to imagine that another assassin
from the organization is in Venice right now.
It should be wide open.
Let's head toward the airport!
We'll get a plane!
We're going to get a plane and head to Sardinia, no matter what.
We must find out about the boss's past as quickly as possible...
or we lose.
Episodio 24 Notorious Chase
It's hard to imagine that another assassin
from the organization is in Venice right now.
It should be wide open.
Let's head toward the airport!
We'll get a plane!
We're going to get a plane and head to Sardinia, no matter what.
We must find out about the boss's past as quickly as possible...
or we lose.
Marco Polo International Airport
I don't feel any life energy.
There are no living creatures on this plane, not even a cockroach.
All right, let's take this plane.
Don't let any living creature or machine near this airplane.
After taking off, an airplane glides at a few thousand to ten thousand meters
Once in the air, there's no Stand user who can control
Our destination is Sardinia.
The flight should be around two hours.
Episodio 24 Notorious Chase
You're gonna fly this thing with Moody Jazz's replay?
B-But there's no guarantee that this thing flew to Sardinia.
I'm pretty sure there's this thing called INS that lets you
I saw it in a movie once.
If I find the INS and input our destination, there shouldn't be an issue.
Really? You're going by what was in a movie?
Abbacchio, how long until takeoff?
No idea. I can't exactly fast forward this.
It'll probably take around ten minutes.
Bucciarati's leg... Was it injured in the restaurant battle?
Still, despite how deep that cut looks, he's barely bleeding.
Up front, to the left! Something's coming!
Something's heading our way, Mista!
Stop right there!
And it's not like a saint would even come here.
Apparently your ears are plugged up with wax, but do your best to listen.
I'll warn you one last time.
I'll let you go, so get the hell off this runway.
He's a Stand user!
Six Bullets!
Giorno! Narancia! Be careful of the enemy!
His signal disappeared.
He's the only enemy in the area.
No one else is trying to get near this plane.
Giorno! As you can see, he died instantly.
There's no need to check up on him.
Yes, I know, but we need to be cautious.
He went down surprisingly easily.
It's like he showed up only to be defeated.
Hey, are you mocking me and my Bullets?
It just means that he was no match for me!
He's obviously way weaker!
Yeah! Yeah!
He's completely dead.
Not only is he not breathing, but his heartbeat and life energy are gone, too.
Mista! Giorno! We're taking off! Hurry up and get on!
Come on, Giorno. Let's go.
I wonder if my father...
might have guessed that I'd go to Sardinia to find out about the past.
Former.
Our former boss.
I'm sure the thought crossed his mind.
That's why we need to find out about the boss's past as soon as possible.
he wasn't a gangster who needed to hide his identity yet.
He became a gangster after that.
He must have some kind of identity.
The true identity of the boss from fifteen years ago surely exists.
As his daughter, you should be able to track it down.
Something, anything...
Cala di Volpe.
Cala di Volpe... The fox's tail?
It's a resort located in a beautiful, emerald green coastal area.
My mother mentioned that she met my father there while on vacation.
She also mentioned that my father grew up in Sardinia.
Apparently, he spoke with a Sardinian dialect.
But then he disappeared, and my mother never found out more than that...
I'm not even sure what I should look for.
Besides, this is all just from my mother's reminiscing.
You're the boss's only living relative.
That's why he's trying to eliminate you.
Cala di Volpe...
That means we have our destination.
Mista.
Get your gun out and take aim.
Listen to this sound...
Sound? You mean the sound of the engine?
What are you talking about?
Just please, get your gun out. There's something weird about this cabinet.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
The only one being weird is you.
You're the one who said there wasn't so much as a cockroach on this plane.
That's true... I don't feel any life energy, even now.
But...
But what?
You sure you're not just freaking out?
I could very well just be freaking out.
But I know I heard something.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm going to open this. Please have your gun ready.
A freezer...
Giorno, what the hell kind of joke is this?
You're trying to scare me with chicken scraps?
Th-That's not chicken.
Aren't these the fingers of the fatty I blasted back at the airport?
Giorno, am I wrong?
Calm down, Mista.
Hey... Is there another one now?
You two. Is something wrong?
Giorno, you confirmed that there weren't any signs of life on this plane.
But Mista is saying that it looked like those fingers increased from three to four.
Is there any life energy in those fingers?
They are just bones. They have no life.
But there's still something really off about this!
Indeed.
I'm not sure how or why, but someone put these in here on purpose.
Let's throw these outside.
Huh?! But opening the door is super dangerous!
Apparently, the difference in air pressure would send us flying like some rat in a toilet!
Everyone, hang on to something.
Zipper Man!
Pop
Guess you didn't need to hang on after all.
Anything else out of the ordinary?
Check every inch of this plane.
I want some pizza, too.
I want to go back to Naples and enjoy a simple Margherita...
This jet looks like a train station bathroom.
But it must be some rich guy's jet...
What the hell is this?
The enemy Stand's name is...
Notorious Chase.
Who wrote all this, and when?
Who the hell wrote this?!
What?!
Th-These fingers...
I-It can't be! We threw the finger bones outside!
We didn't even touch them!
Is this what made that graffiti?
A corpse?
B-But this can't be... The Stand ability of someone who's dead?
Is this thing getting bigger by consuming my body?
Golden Wind!
Cut off my right arm!
What?!
It's consuming my arm in the same shape.
My Stand... is being consumed!
The one who was scribbling on the wall was me...
The one who brought the fingers onto the plane... was me!
What's going on, Giorno?
H-Hey...
Golden Wind!
You should probably make a new right arm fast, Giorno.
Was he trying to jump onto Golden Wind's right arm just now?
What's going on, Giorno? This is unthinkable!
We've never dealt with a Stand like this before.
A Stand... Does that mean the user is hiding somewhere?
The user isn't here.
He's already dead. He died on the runway.
That man came here specifically to die...
Its energy is still alive.
There's no user, so it can keep up with this jet's speed.
But it's super slow, Giorno.
Actually, it's not moving at all. Did it die?
It's not moving?
It's eating, so it doesn't have to move right now.
I got too close. This thing is fast.
My bullets...
It got four of them just now... That's more than half.
Number Two! Three! Six! Seven!
This thing's seriously bad news!
Don't get too close.
Everyone, stay back.
Mista!
Shit! Don't get close to it!
For some reason, it changed its target to Narancia.
It's using some criteria to decide who to attack.
How dare you underestimate me?!
I just need to stay away from it, right?
But...
That movement... It's definitely tracking something.
I-Impossible! It's fast! It's way too fast!
This isn't good! At this rate, it's going to attack all of us!
N-Narancia!
Trish! Hide inside the closet!
What?!
Why is it going after Trish?!
Hurry up and shut the door!
I-I won't make it in time!
Trish!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
I figured out...
It's movement!
It matches the speed of the fastest target and prioritizes it.
we'll get to Sardinia safely.
Then everything will go as planned.
Giorno, wait!
Swap with me! Get that Stand onto me!
We won't make it in time, Bucciarati!
It's climbing up higher!
D-Don't!
Giorno!
How can this be?
Mista!
and both Mista and Narancia are...
How can this be?
My idea to board a plane was naïve...
No one could've predicted this.
And it's because we're on a plane
Regardless, we have to tend to their wounds.
They're all gravely injured.
Hang on a second.
Tend to their wounds... Their wounds...
Giorno's arms...
With Golden Wind's powers...
Golden Wind and Zipper Man's powers activate once their fists hit or touch something.
This is the most damage we've endured so far.
Giorno Giovanna is no longer able to fight.
That probably goes for Mista and Narancia, as well.
Giorno can't recreate the arms that he's lost!
Trish, you should get some rest.
I'm going to go tell Abbacchio.
I'm...
Just for my own safety...
And...
But Giorno and the others are different.
They're making decisions based on
I...
Was that... a ball?
A ball was rolling around?
I-Impossible!
It didn't get blown away by the plane's speed?
No, it's the opposite...
Giorno...
It's movement!
In that case, the plane is moving through the sky...
The faster something is, the more it prioritizes catching it!
It attacked the knife just now because I dropped it...
I want to run into the closet and shut the door.
Slowly...
I have to escape without any sudden movement.
I-It's so sensitive!
Why did it change direction?
It must've reacted to something.
That's... Giorno's brooch?
Could that brooch be...
Golden Wind... No, Giorno's arms...
H-His left hand?
C-Could it be forming his left hand?
Before Giorno cut off his arm, he used Golden Wind to give the ladybug life
and created the hand he lost.
Giorno's not out of the game yet!
Narancia and Mista's wounds can also be healed!
B-But how am I going to do that?!
Episodio 25 Spicy Lady
That's... Giorno's brooch?
C-Could that brooch be...
Giorno's not out of the game yet!
Narancia and Mista's wounds can also be healed!
B-But how am I going to do that?!
Episodio 25 Spicy Lady
B-But if I scream
It's unfortunate for Giorno and the others, but I can't do anything...
And I'll also be the one attacked after the brooch.
I have to hide.
This is...
If I push it, the seat will lean back.
That thing will probably attack this seat before the brooch.
Th-Then I can grab the brooch and head into the cockpit...
B-But I can't!
I can't make a wager like that!
It's far too dangerous.
I need to just hide in the closet...
What's wrong with me?!
Unbelievable.
Now I just have to do it.
The path to the cockpit is wide open!
Move...
Just like the tai chi that the Chinese practice...
It's only about two meters to the brooch.
I can't rush.
It's heading back this way!
But there are more seats to recline.
Why did it... grab on to my leg and not the seat?
L-Liquid?
B-But why are my boots wet?
All I did was push the reclining switch!
I knew it. I should've left the ladybug alone.
I should've just stayed out of this!
S-Save me, Bucciarati!
M-My boot just fell over next to my foot.
It's like it went through my foot...
Wait, what?
Now, pick up that brooch, Trish.
Wh-Who's there?
Is someone there?
ever since you were little.
Trish, please pick up that brooch.
That's the decision you've made.
You've already made up your mind to protect Giorno's left hand.
Hesitation leads to weakness.
Wh-Who are you?
I am you.
I'm also the one who got the thing off of your boot just now.
Now, if you've made your decision, please pick it up.
You and I are going to protect
Giorno's left hand!
And your future, as well.
What's going on?!
Pick it up, Trish!
I'm finished!
How the heck am I supposed to protect this thing?!
This is your ability.
I made the seat softer.
Wh-What just...
Made it softer?
And it somehow damaged that thing.
The fleshy part of that thing ripped.
That thing managed to stop Mista's bullets and catch up to this plane.
But if it hits things that aren't moving, it takes damage.
Are you... me?
The thing with the boot, too. Was that—
is that you picked up the brooch.
You are becoming stronger, both mentally and as a person.
And you are able to make anything in this world softer, more elastic.
Making things softer...
means they become harder to break than diamonds!
I-It's coming again!
This time, stay still.
I'm starting to understand that you're me, but I have to hide!
Make the closet door soft!
Please make it in time!
Damn it! Stay the hell away until I close this door!
I-It managed to find me on the other side of the door, even though I'm hiding!
I-I'm done for!
I'm starting to understand that I'm a Stand user and have Stand abilities...
B-But...
This thing's invincible!
The user is already dead, too. No one can defeat this thing!
Trish, I asked you not to move.
What are you talking about?
I had to run away!
But your ability...
I-It's going to get me!
I-It attacked the clock again?
What?
I made the clock more elastic.
it'll continue to respond to the second hand
When I said not to move, I just meant to move slowly.
Move slowly.
Slower than the second hand.
At super slow speed...
But with the strength of a vise.
We're going to rip this thing apart...
and kill it.
You bastard! Just go to hell already!
You piece of shit! Quit latching on to this world, damn it!
It's falling apart into tiny pieces and disintegrating!
is becoming so small and disappearing...
Y-Your name...
Do you have a name?
What should I call you?
Spicy Lady.
I see...
Trish Una
Spicy Lady
Now Mista and Narancia's wounds can be healed.
But Giorno Giovanna... He is a strange person.
but his actions also helped you mature.
I'm going to go make sure the engines are okay.
Bucciarati, I have some news to break to you...
The problem has already been solved. Giorno has actually already...
Don't say another word!
I-I mean... Slowly...
Our altitude is 7,000 meters!
6,800...
It's no use. It just keeps falling!
And I don't know why!
I figured out why we're falling, Abbacchio.
But what are we supposed to do?
What are we supposed to do about this?
Bucciarati, what are you—
I told you not to move!
D-Don't tell me...
Th-Th-That's... But that's impossible!
Giorno said that thing has the ability to catch up
The engines on this plane... Just now, that thing...
Trish, don't turn around.
Don't panic, no matter what.
Slowly walk this way.
Th-That's...
No! Th-That's impossible!
It's no use! We just keep falling!
At this rate, we're going to crash!
Actually, the engines are likely to explode before that!
Th-That thing should've been torn into pieces and disintegrated...
W-Wait, the engines are right behind the closet.
Oh, no...
If even a tiny part of this thing melded into the wall of the closet...
There's a possibility that it took in the engine's energy.
And now...
We need to make an emergency landing, Abbacchio.
The Tyrrhenian Sea is in front of us.
We need to make an emergency landing on the water.
An emergency landing?
This thing will still come after us!
It's invincible. It's too powerful.
It's an invincible ability!
Now, slowly, Trish...
Slowly, like a slug. Don't panic.
Don't run, whatever you do!
If you rush, it'll attack you!
Wh-What the?!
Yes, it certainly will!
If I do something as lame as moving slow, it's going to catch up to me anyway!
Get in the cockpit, Bucciarati!
Have you lost your mind, Trish?!
Th-The door...
Th-This is...
What the... Don't tell me you...
An emergency landing?
we need to... destroy this plane!
Wannabe!
Spicy Lady!
T-Trish... This is... When did you obtain Stand abilities?
Th-The walls and glass are all soft like rubber.
then crashing would be faster.
A plane crashing is way faster
than this parachute!
Yes! You stupid bastard!
that means the boss's men can't confirm whether we're dead or alive.
Right?
The organization's lost track of us.
That means we've got some time now.
Time to track down the boss's true identity and find him!
No, Abbacchio.
It appears that our damage is going to grow just a bit... just a little bit more.
I'll get rid of that thing.
Wh-What?!
Don't tell me...
It's completely invincible.
There's no way to kill this thing.
We can only chase it out with speed, just like Giorno did.
B-Bucciarati, you can't mean... D-Don't do it!
You're going to wrap that thing onto your arm?!
Don't! Are you going to take yourself out of this, too?!
No, Abbacchio.
Giorno's Golden Wind ability
is safe right here.
Wh-When did you...
Arrivederci.
"Goodbye."
Stand name: Notorious Chase.
Complete annihilation: impossible.
Forced to track the crashing waves of the sea forever.
At times, it attacks ships that happen to move faster than the waves and sinks them.
Eventually, these waters would be known to local fishermen as the "Tyrrhenian Belly"
and considered ominous.
Now, let's lay low and find out who the boss really is.
We're going to track down my father's past!
The private jet hijacked from the Marco Polo International Airport
crash-landed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, fifty kilometers northeast of Sardinia.
This mystery has yet to be solved.
No passengers were found on board.
Unbelievable. This is why blood relations are so troublesome.
but once blood relations are involved, things become tricky.
But that's all it is.
I'll be able to remain in the prime of my life.
Every morning of her life, Trish awoke in this house...
And...
But this date... There's no doubt about it.
It's fifteen years ago.
This portrait... Even I almost missed it.
To think that such a thing existed...
Their plane crashed... but they're alive.
I can feel it...
I can also tell that she's alive and heading to Sardinia.
that means he's also alive, at the very least.
I can't let Moody Jazz go to the spot in this picture.
Trish might not realize it right now, but she'll surely remember
the existence of this picture.
And if she goes to Sardinia, she'll figure out
that the person who took this portrait of her mother when she was young
was me!
I can't let Moody Jazz's ability replay that!
I'll have to go there myself.
I have to do it myself.
I can't let any of my subordinates attempt to handle this.
Oh, y-you were home.
I knocked, but... I'm here to clean your room.
P-Pardon me, I'll come back later...
Huh?
Huh?
O-Oh, right! To clean! I'm supposed to clean!
Now, time to get to work.
A Little Story From the Past ~My Name Is Doppio~
Episodio 26 A Little Story From the Past ~My Name Is Doppio~
This is a little story from the past.
Summer, 1965
We're going back to the summer of 1965.
Prisoner 696! What's going on here?!
Prisoner 696!
She's pregnant?
There are only women here!
Not to mention, this prisoner
She's been here for two years already.
Push! Just a little bit more!
When could she have gotten pregnant?
And now...
Hey, you! Who the hell's this kid's father?!
He's... dead...
For over two years... now...
You can't be serious.
Looks like the baby made it.
Yes... But something's strange.
And he's not crying at all.
This goes without saying, but we can't raise a baby here.
We'll find someone to take him.
Where are you from?
Sar...di...nia...
A priest at a small church there took the child in.
Time passed, and the boy became known as someone
June, 1985
Well, I'll be going now. See you later, Mr. Frog.
Hey, watch it!
Oh, it's you.
Walk closer to the edge, you dumbass!
Don't you dare tell the priest about this.
Th-That was close...
But I'm glad you didn't get squished.
Do you like frogs?
I like frogs, too.
I also don't like guys who smell.
I hate everything that's not beautiful.
Are you from around here?
Y-Yeah...
Say, it's a bit hot out. Want to get something to drink?
Well...
That's not a bad idea.
Then I want sparkling water.
Hard water from France.
I hope you're treating.
You want to become a sailor?
Yeah...
Well...
That's probably best for you.
Oh?
He walked all this way?
Good on him.
It might be a good idea to get him a car.
What's this?
A corpse?
As he carefully picked at the concrete...
The person he discovered was a woman.
It was the woman who gave birth to the boy the priest took in.
Sh-She's alive...
She couldn't move nor talk, but somehow, she was being kept alive.
How many years had it been?
Hatred? Love?
This hair color...
No one knows how it started.
Seven people died, and others went missing.
On the list of the deceased were
the names of the priest and the boy he'd taken in.
Olbia, Sardinia: Present Day
Why, you!
Hey, kid! Look out!
Shut up. I know.
You bastard!
O-Ow...
Aw, man... Ow.
Guess I had the wrong idea.
Looks like you're down on your luck. Having a bad day?
Or have you been having a streak of bad luck?
I'd say so. I've had one problem after another.
Why not let me tell your fortune?
I'll make it cheap.
Huh? Nah, I'll pass...
Sardinia is your home, isn't it?
And it's been a while since you've been back here, hasn't it?
I wouldn't call that fortunetelling.
You can tell I'm a traveler just by looking at me.
You're... living with a secret.
You could probably call it two separate lives.
What?
Oh, please forgive my rudeness.
There's something about your face that is very intriguing to someone in my field.
Please, let me tell you your fortune.
I'll make it 20,000... no, 10,000 lire.
Everyone has their secrets.
You're looking for someone.
Seriously...
Everyone spends their lives looking for someone.
A beautiful girlfriend or a good friend...
But I guess it's nice to hear these things at times.
With that crystal ball?
No... I've already begun.
I can tell just by looking at the shape of the mud splatter on your pants.
Because that is the symbol of fate.
Your daughter...
You came back to Sardinia to find the child of the woman you left fifteen years ago...
Huh?
Huh? Er... Something's strange.
I know what I just said, but this is strange...
Whose child? Mine?
But you have one. I'm sure of it.
Let me see your palm!
Hey!
Please! My pride as a fortuneteller is on the line here!
Let go of my hand... Don't touch me...
I won't ask for payment... Actually, I'll pay you!
20,000... No, I'll pay you 100,000 lire!
Please!
You're friggin' annoying! Don't touch me!
What good would it do for you to see it, huh?!
Considering you're about to die!
Your face... Your age...
It appears you're not a Stand user.
You have the wisdom to see people
That was your greatest failing.
No one in this world is allowed to know who I really am.
But I now know that you are indeed an excellent fortuneteller.
Out of respect for that, I'll be sure to kill you instantly so you don't feel any pain.
So answer my question...
This man's name is Risotto.
He's a traitor.
He is also looking for my daughter and trying to find out my true identity.
I want you to tell me where he is right now.
Where he is?
But I'm sure you'll encounter him soon.
He's here in Sardinia...
I see. Very well.
That's plenty.
I knew it!
Two personalities!
and you will never lose your splendor!
What a beautiful palm!
I've never seen a hand like this before!
Huh? Something's wrong. It suddenly looks strange.
The lifeline is totally different...
I see!
This is my own hand! It changed before I even realized it!
Emperor Crimson.
You...
I'm so glad you weren't squished.
Go on, shoo.
Be careful. Go on.
Huh?
Where to, sir?
Costa Smeralda, please.
You got it.
the investigations involving the site of the crash off the Olbia coast in Sardinia.
However...
Driver, do you have a cell phone?
Mine broke...
No, I don't. Sorry.
I see...
I'll get out here! This is fine!
I'll get out here.
That's the building.
I just have to keep an eye out over there.
Costa Smeralda in Sardinia.
Hey, wait a sec!
So you actually think I rigged the meter
Is that what you think? Huh?!
N-No... But 800,000 lire to get from the city to here seems a bit...
I don't have that much.
Like hell a guy on vacation doesn't have money!
I know you hid some in your pocket earlier.
I saw you hide an envelope in your pants.
Don't—
Come on, let me see.
Don't touch me... I-I'm getting a headache...
See? I knew it.
You friggin' idiot!
Those who have seen what they shouldn't have seen
Y-You bastard...
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Hey... Did you just hear a phone ring?
Huh?
Where did it come from?
Hey! I asked you a question!
That phone's busted, so there's no way it could've rung!
H-Hell if I know! What are you—
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
There it is again! Where is it?
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Where is it?
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Hey, what the hell? You have a car phone!
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Hello? Yes, this is Doppio.
Boss... Yes, I just arrived.
I just need to keep an eye on this place, right?
Right. I'm very sorry, Boss.
You're about to watch the building?
No, my Doppio.
Take a good look. Slowly... Naturally.
Don't do anything suspicious.
The one who's being watched...
Th-That's Risotto! The traitor assassin!
He appeared just like the fortuneteller said!
We need to take care of him first.
I'll be the one to finish him off.
We need to get close to him without him figuring out my true identity.
Risotto's ability is a mystery to me, as well.
Draw him out about two meters away from you.
Then he'll definitely be within Emperor Crimson's range.
You can do it.
Yes, I understand, Boss.
What's this? My head... It hurts.
O-Oh, yeah. I don't have time to worry about a headache.
I just had a call from the boss.
My mission is to keep an eye on that building and... uh...
What was it again?
Get closer?
But to what?
I won't get closer to you.
Look over here.
Wh-What the?!
Wh-Who is he again?
Move your hand.
Otherwise, I can't see your face.
I-I don't have any money!
B-Blood!
Maybe I just imagined it.
If he was from Passione, he wouldn't act like this.
Not to mention, he's more unguarded than a baby.
He must be a civilian.
Please don't!
Stop fussing. I'm just going to pick up my knife.
I don't care about you anymore.
I-I don't feel so good... My head hurts...
T-Two meters...
That's right.
It's right under your left shoe.
What are you hiding?
What is your deal?!
It wasn't murderous intent or hostility, but your expression there seemed fake.
Stand up, move your left leg, and show me.
I told you to stand up! Stand up!
Oh, so it's just an envelope.
There's nothing in it.
But now... I'm even more interested in you.
You're definitely a Stand user.
You heard that sound, too, didn't you?
Just now, you glanced over toward that sound.
That's the sound of scouting.
It's carefully scouting the area.
That sound and shape...
is Li'l Bomber!
They've finally made it here!
And who are you to show up to such an important location?
It must mean that the boss trusts you greatly.
But there is true fear in your heart.
You're a walking contradiction!
Shut your trap!
I see.
Your range is around two to three meters.
As long as I know that, I know how I'll kill you.
What... the... M-My throat!
Th-These are...
T-Two meters, damn it!
I'll shove these razor blades right up your ass!
I told you, I know how I'll kill you.
Impossible! I'm not done yet, damn it!
H-He disappeared?
That's his... That's his assassin ability...
But how...
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
There's a phone ringing somewhere!
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
I can't believe it!
Click!
Beep!
Hello?!
My Doppio...
Wh-Where are you, Boss?
Are you nearby?
If you are, please come quickly!
I cannot.
I cannot go there until you get close enough to him.
Because everything will be over
B-But—
You need to get closer. You need to get within two meters of Risotto!
Boss! I don't know what his ability is!
He could attack me again at any second!
Doppio...
My adorable little Doppio...
Did you forget that I gave you a portion of my Emperor Crimson's power?
Now is the time to use it!
Episodio 27 Emperor Crimson vs. Metallic
Rome, Italy
What do you call this?!
You expect me to eat spaghetti with ink in it?!
Well sir, this is spaghetti al nero di seppia.
It is made with fresh squid ink, so it is black.
Huh?
It's quite tasty, sir.
Yum! Well isn't this a treat?
I like it! It's good!
This hotel is going to the dogs. They'll let anyone in these days.
Signorina, this is a gift for you.
Oh, it's lovely!
My pretty thing, when you remove this
Oh, no! Did that stuck-up snob really just say that?!
It's sweet enough to make my teeth hurt!
I'll put a spell on it.
Make her fall to my love charm.
I can't stand guys like that!
And spread your magic to her lips.
That insinuating little dog! I see his game!
It's a travesty!
Here we go.
A little Hamon prank.
Th-This can't be!
I-It's Hamon!
He used Hamon!
Excuse me, you have a call from a Mr. Speedwagon, Mr. Caesar Zeppeli.
Mamma mia! I'll be right there.
Wh-What the...!
That skirt-chasing Casanova is the Zeppeli we're here to meet?!
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 14: Elite Ancient Warriors
The Speedwagon Foundation, founded 28
The Speedwagon Foundation's Washington headquarters
It furthers science, medicine, archaeology and more...
...for the benefit of all humankind.
But it has a deeper purpose.
To find the secrets of the stone masks!
We're using UV lights. Put on your masks, please.
Introduce the snake!
The snake was absorbed!
Santviento isn't dead! He's defending himself somehow!
He'll awaken in the darkness.
Impossible! How can we kill him?
He feeds on masked vampires, and he's immortal!
But be at ease, Mr. Speedwagon.
As long as he's under these UV lights, he won't be able to move.
That's right.
What a relief.
Let's take our time and research a way to stop him.
These were taken in the cave where we found Santviento.
Look carefully.
Their horns are all different!
If the one on the bottom is Santviento, who are the others?
According to von Stroheim, the Germans found another Pillar in Europe.
Is that true?!
They are in a vertical line.
That could indicate the ranks of the Pillar Men.
Von Stroheim told us to meet a man in Rome, so JoJo and I are going.
That man...
...is the grandson of Will A. Zeppeli, Caesar Zeppeli!
So where are you from?
Shall I take a photo of you with the fountain?
The birds in this country sure are friendly.
Can't say I like the men, though!
Come, now! You've been introduced, so why can't you be civil?!
Allow me to be frank, Mr. Speedwagon.
My grandfather died tragically fifty years ago.
My father took up his torch and hunted the mask.
We Italians have the strongest family bonds in the world.
We are proud of tradition. I am no different.
But what about that man?
You say he knew nothing of his grandfather until recently!
Such irresponsibility!
I'd watch what I say, if--!
Hold on, Caesar!
I kept everything a secret from JoJo!
Even so.
He fought Straizo and one of the Pillar Men.
So I wondered how tough he was and waited for him.
I saw what he could do with Hamon and was disappointed.
His Hamon is simply not enough!
His victory against the Pillar Man was blind luck for sure.
I will never work with him!
Caesar, he hasn't trained with Hamon!
It's too late, old man.
I'll show you with a good thrashing.
That won't happen.
With your Hamon, you couldn't even beat this girl.
Then you couldn't even beat a pigeon!
Are you making fun of me?
I love to make fun, but I won't be made fun of!
H-He gave this girl a Hamon kiss.
I'll say it again.
You couldn't even beat this girl.
S-Should I stop them?
No, even if it's hard on him, if he can't get through this...
What did I tell you?
My grandfather only died because your grandfather got in his way!
I can't accept someone of your bloodline!
Caesar, that's too far!
Y-You...
You couldn't leave it at just me, you had to insult my dead grandfather!
I have a technique sure to eliminate the Pillar Men.
My Hamon Bubble Launcher!
My gloves and clothing are coated in a special soap mixture!
I'll blast you back home, Joestar!
I'm impressed you're still conscious, but your Hamon won't break you out.
And look at that, your breathing is ragged.
Enjoy your stay.
Now you'll say, Signorina, I will lift my Hamon spell.
Here, signorina, I will lift my Hamon spell.
I put a Hamon-filled pigeon in her mouth while I was being choked.
I knew you'd kiss her again to remove your Hamon.
I'll say it again.
You couldn't even beat a pigeon!
What a day.
Who does this jerk think he is?
Does he have to grandstand just to sit down?
He really ticks me off.
If I had a technique like his Bubble Launcher, he wouldn't be so proud.
I have to come up with something.
But working at it would be a hassle.
I'll show him what's what with a card game.
What are you up to, JoJo? Deal the cards normally.
What do you mean?
I told you to deal normally!
No tricks!
Wh-Whoa-oa!
Oh, no! I've been caught!
Well, you can't beat me without resorting to sly gimmicks like that.
So what is this mirror on your shoe for, eh?
You want a piece of me?!
Bring it, rube!
Caesar!
It's been eight hours. What are you waiting for?
What am I waiting for?
Here's your answer!
What's this?! A German soldier!
It looks like we're clear.
The Germans guard the Pillar Men.
He'll get us in to see them.
You're serious?!
Germany and Italy have an alliance!
And the Germans want to do scientific research on my Hamon.
You're Englishmen, but you're allowed to see the Pillar Men.
You can thank my painstaking efforts for that, JoJo.
Mr. Speedwagon, we have many questions.
Let's work together to stop them before they wake.
Hey, Mark.
How is your girlfriend back home?
Well, she's...
Th-The truth is...
...I'm going home to get married next week!
Really?!
Mamma mia! Congratulations!
I was his wingman when he picked her up!
Hey, keep your eyes on the road!
Stop nuzzling the wheel!
By the way, JoJo...
...do you have a girlfriend?
Of course not.
No girl would want to date a guy like you.
It would be easier to find Nessie!
This guy really thinks he's hot stuff!
I'll come up with a killer technique and teach him a thing or two!
Look! Something's strange!
Wh-What's going on?!
Calm down! They're under UV lights! They can't move.
Take care and look into it.
Yes, sir!
The death of von Stroheim's team was an important lesson.
We have to cut the Pillar out and put it in a bunker in Germany.
What's happening? There's a shadow, so I can't tell.
Take a closer look.
I-I hear something.
His horn!
H-He couldn't be...!
He's awake!
Bring out more UV lamps!
Yes, sir!
H-He's blocking the UV light with blood and brain matter!
The world has changed while I slept.
I can see how in these paltry inventions.
H-He spoke!
Do you think you can hold me with your feeble lights?!
Our hands!
They're stuck together!
Wamuu!
Awaken, my masters!
The famous Mouth of Truth was a secret entrance all this time?!
This place is so unearthly!
Caesar, have you tried Hamon on the sleeping Pillar Men?
Hamon is only useful on the living. It has no effect on stone.
It won't work unless they are awake.
Hey, where are the guards that are supposed to be here?!
No one's here! It's too quiet!
You're too loud.
T-This isn't right.
There should be a guard posted here.
What?
Whoa!
Hey, I just stepped in something!
It's the grossest feeling ever!
What the heck is it?!
Th-They're...!
The husks of soldiers!
Th-They're all dead!
No way!
Hey, Dutch! Don't run off!
Something's out there!
Wh-What is that?!
This can't be! Th-They're...!
Awake!
Get out of there, Mark!
Mark!
Mark!
Caesar... Caesar!
Mark!
They didn't even notice what happened when one of them bumped into Mark!
It's like when a man steps on an ant while walking!
It is night outside, Wamuu.
Yes, Lord Kars. What is your plan?
Searching for the whereabouts of the Red Stone of Aja, of course.
All we need is the Stone and the Mask will be complete!
But Master Esidisi, the human world has changed much over the years.
Long ago, the Emperor of Rome had the Stone.
But that age has ended, I am sure.
Then we must find out where the Stone has gone.
They say the Emperor cherished the Stone.
I am sure humans still tell stories of it.
I shall find the Stone.
We have time.
For now, let us go outside and observe the changes in the human world.
Wamuu!
What are you doing, worm?!
Stay your hand, Esidisi!
I apologize, Lord Kars.
Wamuu, I know how you hate when someone enters your shadow.
I forgot how you reflexively attack anyone who does.
It has been 2,000 years, after all.
I have offended you, my lord. Punish me as you see fit.
No, there is no reason for it.
It is that very fighting spirit that lets me rely on you.
The fault is mine for entering your shadow.
Forgive me, Wamuu.
Lord Kars...
We go, Wamuu.
Yes, lord.
Caesar!
Kill me! Kill me now!
Mark!
I-It's starting to hurt.
I-I'm so scared.
I was numb at first, but the pain...!
Please kill me now, Caesar!
Mark!
There's nothing we can do!
We can't do anything to help him.
We're powerless!
The hopelessness is overwhelming!
C-Caesar...
You...
Thank you, Caesar.
Mark!
He was just a young man.
Just an ordinary man.
He loved his family.
And his girl.
And his country.
He was a normal, hardworking young man.
He was just a kid!
Caesar!
JoJo, stay out of this!
This fight is mine!
I have to do this myself!
Next episode
Oh, I'm tired of talking.
I told you to continue!
He's spineless!
The Hamon tribe.
This is my Divine Sandstorm!
Chapter 15: A Hero's Proof
Doppio...
Did you forget that I gave you a portion of my Emperor Crimson's power?
Now is the time to use it!
You have Emperor Crimson's arms and Eulogy!
Calm down and look carefully for movements.
And then try to predict the future movements that will occur around you.
Look carefully and predict the future movements that will happen
Episodio 27 Emperor Crimson vs. Metallic
B-Birds!
B-Boss! I just saw him!
He was blended into the footage of ten seconds from now that Eulogy showed me!
It looked like a person had blended into the rocks in the background!
B-But I can't see him right now!
That's Risotto.
He's somehow hiding his appearance.
Could it be...
Look a few seconds into the future to see how he's going to attack, Doppio!
Th-There he is!
Wh-What?!
Th-This is awful, Boss!
In ten seconds, s-scissors are going to c-come out of my throat!
Calm down, Doppio.
Risotto is the assassin that no one in the organization could find.
You should expect a little bit of damage.
You need to see how he's going to attack you
The fact that he gets close to me
Th-This footage showing that there'll be scissors inside my throat...
Does it mean this future is unchangeable, Boss?!
Correct.
Now that you've seen that footage, you're going to have to prepare yourself.
It's true that you're going to have scissors shoved down your throat.
But see through it!
If you can see through his methods, you'll find his weakness!
And then, get within two meters of him
Damn it!
There you are! Take this!
You're sloppy.
How truly interesting.
How did you know?
I'm curious about your ability.
But still... you're going to die!
I-Impossible!
How did he get the scissors under my skin?
He hasn't laid a finger on me, and I haven't opened my mouth.
H-His Stand hasn't even touched me...
A-At this rate, he's going to chop open my throat!
!
I need to get them out!
Those movements...
He just put his hand to his throat and defended himself.
There's something going on.
I need to be more careful...
God damn you!
Damn it... I couldn't tell.
The boss is going to be upset with me.
I still don't know how he's invisible.
B-But this damage... I-I'm losing strength in my legs...
Th-That's—
What's the matter, Doppio?
Were you able to see his attack?
B-Boss!
You couldn't see it?
Figure out exactly where he is by having him chase you!
Y-You bastard!
I've made up my mind.
Damn it.
You just saw Emperor Crimson's next footage, didn't you?
What did you see?
I'm asking you a question, Doppio!
What did you see?
My right foot, Boss.
It went flying off.
My foot is going to go flying off.
What did you say, Doppio?!
H-He's coming! I saw a glimpse of him!
Get away from there right now!
Why didn't you move immediately after seeing the footage, Doppio?
Risotto Nero, the assassin.
While his movements are careful, he's already made preparations to kill me.
I can't get my legs to move.
Razor blades, scissors...
He was preparing for me to lose all this stamina!
Shit. Doppio won't be able to win now.
It's going to take me at least ten seconds to come out.
This isn't good.
The damage he'd endure from losing his foot would be less than ideal.
I need to minimize the damage somehow.
I'm telling you to move away from there now!
You're going to be killed!
But, Boss, if I may interject...
That's exactly why I shouldn't move.
I've used up my stamina.
All I've been thinking about is where he was attacking me from
But I was going about it the wrong way!
There you are!
His ability...
The fact that this frog and I are so worn out gave me the answer!
You use your Stand ability
And given that the razor blades came out of the frog before they came out of me...
That's the direction you were approaching from!
Th-This bastard...
Looks like the prediction was correct.
And the mystery behind the enemy's form is slowly becoming apparent, Boss.
Huh? Boss?
That's strange. I could've sworn I was holding a phone...
Where did I drop it?
I mean, that's a frog...
Oh, there it is!
How the heck did I drop it down there?
It's underneath all these rocks, and now it's covered in sand.
Oh, jeez. And I need to report to the boss immediately, too...
D-Did it break?
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Yes!
As small as they make electronics these days, I guess they're pretty sturdy!
Hello? Praise me, Boss. He can't move anymore.
Impossible...
Well done, Doppio.
Am I going to be the one to finish him off?
I want to make sure that Risotto Nero is finished off for good.
I'll take care of him myself.
Get closer to him, Doppio. Get within two meters of him...
And then, I'll go there.
Until then, get closer to him.
You got it! I'll get closer to him, Boss!
Inside the wound where his foot was severed...
Risotto's Stand is inside his body!
You have precognitive powers, don't you?
You had a decent idea of what would happen and how I would move.
Otherwise, there's no way you could've predicted my position or my attack.
It's true that, at first, you were a beginner who couldn't do anything on your own.
But... who are you right now?
Your personality is now filled with confidence.
And what's that look on your face?
Those eyes don't belong to a young man.
It's as if there are two of you.
Shink
Could that be what's going on?
No, that's not it.
There's no doubt about it.
I'm much closer than I realize...
to the one I'm after right now!
Two years.
It's been two years since we were
You're definitely something more than what we've been looking for.
I'm certain of it.
I want to know what you are.
I want to see your true form.
I want to know what you are when I kill you... no matter what!
Risotto Nero
Metallic
Solido Naso... That's probably one of the boss's aliases.
Otherwise, he wouldn't hide his daughter so quickly.
We came all the way here, but it's just a waste of damn time.
Damn it.
Right, Bro?
We haven't been able to make a move
I wonder who's guarding his daughter.
Pericolo's not a Stand user, so maybe it's Polpo.
Then maybe we should head toward Naples and ask him.
Don't get ahead of yourselves.
It's times like these that you should remain calm before doing anything.
Failure equals death.
I'm excited, but...
The one who gets too excited in this situation is the one who dies.
The foot I chopped off!
I was right. Risotto Nero...
I can now see your powers! Magnetism!
You're controlling your Stand at that distance with magnetism!
You took control of the iron inside me
The way you make yourself disappear is by covering yourself in iron powder
and camouflaging yourself to match the scenery around you!
Correct.
You may have figured out what Metallic is, but it's too late.
Because you are already complete.
Iron.
as well as spring water and plants.
And of course, iron is also found within humans, as well.
b
What are you doing, Doppio?
You predicted his movements!
I will not allow you to receive further damage!
Th-This is... B-Boss!
You saw through my ability, and my foot got chopped off.
But you are already complete.
There's nothing you can do about that.
Large amounts of iron can be found in
It's an important substance that's within your bloodstream.
What happens when all the iron within you leaves your body at once?
To put it simply, your blood turns a horrible shade of yellow and you die.
The iron in your blood captures the oxygen
and carries it throughout your body.
Without that, the precious oxygen doesn't reach your fingertips or your brain.
Your body is going to become a corpse before you actually die.
Now, then...
Should I wait until you croak, or...
B-Boss...
That's...
They're near the mansion!
It's Bucciarati!
He finally showed himself!
Narancia's also there, and... Abbacchio's there, too!
What? Abbacchio's there?
We're out of time.
Doppio, finish him off with your next move!
Predict Risotto's movements in the footage!
I'm already looking!
Risotto will come around my right side, and then...
I-It can't be...
What do you see, Doppio?
What do you see?
I'm gonna turn the tables, damn it!
I'll finish him off, Boss!
A few seconds before what happens in this footage happens...
I'll blow off his head instead!
Just like I chopped off his foot earlier!
H-Here he comes!
Don't do anything else, Doppio!
There's nothing else you can do.
Listen well, Doppio. This is important.
Don't waste any more energy.
I'm heading there right now.
It'll be a few more seconds, but I'll deal with Risotto.
A few seconds?!
Deal with it!
But I'm the one who's going to be attacked!
So I'll finish him off!
Doppio! This is the only way!
This is the only way you're going to survive!
Your body can't take any more.
I won't allow you to waste any more energy on my behalf!
You're going to finish him off?
But what if I can, Boss?
If I know where he is...
If his ability is going to try to steal even more iron from my body...
H-Here he comes! He's attacking!
He should have the strength to pull...
The scalpel is pointing in the direction of the magnetic force!
You're right there, Risotto!
I figured that's what you'd do.
Magnetism pulls at the iron.
However, unfortunately...
What you sensed was
I left it there.
I need to make the best of that situation.
There's barely any oxygen left in your body.
You are complete.
You shouldn't even be able to move an inch.
You're different from before.
and the way you're talking to yourself...
It all makes sense now.
Yes, this had already been confirmed in 16th century Germany.
There are people in this world who have multiple personalities.
In some cases, it doesn't just affect them mentally.
I had just thought that you were the boss's most trusted subordinate.
But you...
I can't wait.
There's nothing else you can do.
I'm keeping my distance.
There's nothing you can do!
I've won!
This is the end! Take this!
Metallic!
Wh-What?
that you were no longer an enemy he could handle.
Don't tell me...
I knew it. The enemy was already here.
But I shot right through him! I hit him good, too!
Y-You...
If the blood in my body that's been robbed of iron
It's the same thing as if my body wasn't breathing.
Which means that the only thing Li'l Bomber can track right now...
How many enemies are there, Narancia?
Just one!
There's only one person breathing on that cliff!
...is your breathing, Risotto.
I see.
This is the same thing that happened in the footage that Doppio saw, but...
I was winning...
But you had thrown the scalpels at them...
Boss...
Episodio 28 Beneath a Sky on the Verge of Falling
Episodio 28: Beneath a Sky on the Verge of Falling
Which means that the only thing Li'l Bomber can track right now...
I was winning...
I would've won...
But you had thrown the scalpels at them...
Boss...
He's down! Li'l Bomber finished him off!
All right.
Hold on, Abbacchio.
We don't know how many of the boss's men are on this beach right now.
and replay the footage of the one who took the photo of Trish's mother
We need to get out of here as soon as we can, or we'll be in danger.
But there's only one of them on the cliff!
Bucciarati, I remember the Stand from the plane.
Despite Mista turning that guy into a corpse, we still went through hell.
I have to confirm who's up on that cliff, or I won't be able to relax.
Narancia, is the enemy up there dead?
He's barely hanging on.
But his breathing has just about ceased.
He hasn't moved a millimeter.
All right.
Abbacchio.
Use your Moody Jazz to get the replay going right away.
All right.
We can't stay here for too long.
Well, we're talking fifteen years ago.
It'll probably take eight to ten minutes.
Do it in five.
Giorno, Trish, and Mista are standing by in the turtle, so I'll bring them out here, too.
we'll leave here.
Narancia, use Li'l Bomber to signal for Giorno and the others to get out here.
You got it!
I finally... figured it out...
I know... your identity...
Before I die...
I will not allow you to continue this conversation any longer, Risotto Nero.
The last thing I wanted was for Bucciarati and his crew to find out we were here.
You should die with pride as the leader
I'm sure your men who are waiting in the afterlife will be proud of you.
You're going to die at any second.
And Bucciarati will come find you up here at any moment.
Before that happens, give me back all the iron you stole from my body.
If you do, I'll finish you off myself.
Wouldn't it be the worst embarrassment of your life if you were
Not to mention, they already consider you a pathetic enemy.
I... die...
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Hurry up and give me back the iron that was in my body, Risotto Nero.
I'm saying... that I won't die alone.
Within the chunks of flesh that Li'l Bomber blew off...
The parts of me that scattered...
This time, I'll be the one using it...
Li'l Bomber, that is!
Die!
What the heck? Li'l Bomber is...
That bastard stuck itself to my Li'l Bomber!
m
Emperor Crimson.
I blew away 0.5 seconds' worth of time.
Just the results of the bullets hitting you.
Rata tat tat tat tat tat
Well done, Risotto Nero.
But that also means I'm still facing this unfortunate predicament.
This isn't good.
Are you sure, Narancia?
Yeah.
Something made its way into Li'l Bomber!
Shit!
They're coming...
I have to hide... and somehow replenish my iron...
Stop right here.
We need to assess the situation carefully from here.
Got it.
It's all right, Bucciarati.
He's definitely dead.
Though, I shot him in the face, so it might be hard to tell who he actually was.
That man is probably the leader of the Hitman Team.
How can you tell?
He's here alone without a team, which means that either
or he had no one left on his team.
And he was just killed by whoever this other very confident killer was
Uh, hello? Bucciarati?
You're wrong. You were just being used.
There was someone else here.
Look at his right foot.
Li'l Bomber's attacks would have left burn marks.
But there are no burn marks on that foot.
It was only torn off.
But... there was only one person on Li'l Bomber's radar!
I'm still not getting any other signal!
And why would anyone need to do that, anyway?!
Neither of them likely expected
the other to be as powerful as themselves, so the survivor is probably very badly wounded.
Though, I don't know how they're hiding their breathing.
Narancia, you sent out a signal for Giorno and the others to gather, didn't you?
They should be heading to the place the picture came from right now.
All right, let's go after them.
The other killer is still nearby.
He's an extremely dangerous killer sent by the organization.
Damn it...
all because of those bastards...
I know this is a rocky area, but there are way more than I expected.
there are just too many!
Damn it! Should I just light this whole place up?!
Calm down!
Frogs and field mice will try to hide in nearby holes.
Those aren't the movements you're looking for.
Look for the movement of someone trying to get away from us.
Movement of someone trying to get away from us...
I have to hurry...
Abbacchio...
I have to stop his Stand!
That must be it.
Hey, where are Narancia and Bucciarati?
I only see Abbacchio on the beach.
An enemy must've appeared.
They're probably pursuing the enemy.
And it seems that Abbacchio hasn't started his replay yet.
but she doesn't know the exact date.
Moody Jazz is searching with a timer for the exact time.
When it figures that out...
It'll be able to change into the boss.
Let's go.
Hey, let's play over here.
You're the goalie today.
What? No way!
Rock-paper-scissors, then!
Well? Can you tell them apart?
I found it, Bucciarati! There's just one!
It's 80 meters to our right.
but it's headed toward the tourists!
Narancia, don't attack just yet!
First, we have to determine exactly who we're dealing with.
His movement stopped.
Bucciarati?
Blood?
You, there! I'm about to attack you!
If you are unable to fight anymore, come out from behind that rock.
I promise not to take your life.
I'll wait just three seconds. Got it?
It's been three seconds!
Zipper Man!
p
Hey, come on!
Where the heck are you kicking the ball? You suck!
Oh, come on!
It's your fault for not being able to get it!
Just shut up and go get it already!
You go get it!
It's already the 25th. June's going to be over soon.
How long is this gonna take?
Higher! Higher, damn it!
Throw some rocks at it!
Shake the branches! Climb up there!
Hey! Pipe down, you little brats!
Go play someplace where there's more room!
Duh, we know that.
Who the heck kicked it up there?
Hey! Stop throwing rocks!
Reach out your hand a little more!
I know, damn it!
I can't reach any further!
Oh, hell. Go on, move out of the way!
What the hell is this?!
Wait.
He's just a kid! He's one of the tourists!
His mouth is sewn shut with the laces from his sneakers!
Only a Stand user could have done this.
They must've switched places with him.
And by the look of this kid, he seems to have lost a lot of blood.
But where did all that blood go?
What the hell?! Where's the bastard that did this to him?!
How the hell did he disappear?!
He was super weak a second ago!
I don't know...
Thanks!
All right!
C'mon, let's hurry!
Thanks, mister!
Thanks!
Hey, wait up!
Thanks!
Nothing beats coming back home.
Luck's on my side.
Let's go!
Kick it right this time!
You're the one who kicked it over there!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Leone Abbacchio
Moody Jazz
Uh... What are you doing under there, officer?
Sorry to bother you while you're eating.
I'm conducting an investigation.
I'm looking for fingerprints.
There was a robbery across the street last night.
The victim was struck with a bottle.
It shattered, and shards went everywhere.
But all the shards weren't on the sidewalk.
Particularly the part that was being held.
I should be able to get some fingerprints.
That's the part I'm looking for.
You're going to look through all that?
Well, it's my job.
I see.
Yeah...
Say, uh...
Yes?
For reference... I'm just curious.
What are you going to do if you don't find the shards?
You might not get any fingerprints.
and the suspect hires a crafty lawyer and is found not guilty...
What makes you keep working so hard despite all those problems?
Well...
When all you want is the result, you start to look for shortcuts.
And if you take that shortcut, you might lose sight of the truth.
You'll become less motivated.
I think the most important thing is the will to find the truth.
even if the suspect gets away this time, you'll get them eventually, right?
Because that's what you're after.
Don't you think so?
I envy you.
I used to think I wanted to become a police officer.
I wanted to become a distinguished police officer.
At some point, I even had that same will you have.
But I messed up.
You see, people like me
are worthless.
We never see things to the end.
We always mess up somewhere along the way.
That's not true, Abbacchio.
You're doing great.
We have the same will.
That will you had when you first became a police officer
resides within your heart again now...
Abbacchio.
Why...
Come to think of it...
Where are you going, Abbacchio?
I'm getting on that bus!
I'm starting to remember...
That's right!
I need to get back to my comrades!
Did you forget, Abbacchio?
You came here on that bus.
This is the last stop.
You can never return.
Y-You're...
That's right! You're...
You're the one who died because I took that bribe...
Abbacchio, you did very well.
That's right...
No way...
This can't be happening!
God damn it! You can't be serious!
Hurry up and heal him, Giorno!
I said hurry up and heal him!
Don't make me kick your face in, you bastard!
It happened in a moment...
It happened in a second at close range.
We were too late...
We were too late.
How could someone like Abbacchio
let him get that close?
Mista...
The enemy will probably attack again, to try to finish Trish off.
We have to leave here immediately.
This is my fault.
We can't gather any more clues about the boss here.
Wh-What are you talking about, Bucciarati?
Abbacchio is gonna wake up any second!
It's just taking a bit longer than usual!
He'll wake up if we just wait a little longer!
Right, Giorno?!
That's what happened before, right?
H-Hey!
That's enough, Narancia!
It's too dangerous here!
You need to use Li'l Bomber to survey the area.
What are you talking about, Bucciarati?
What the hell are you talking about?!
If the enemy's gonna show up, I'll kill him right here, right now!
If he's nearby, I'll face him head-on!
Mista! Right, Giorno?
Hey, Mista!
We have to go, Narancia.
Just as Bucciarati said!
Wh-What?
What did you just say?!
Giorno!
Bring him back!
Give it all you have, you bastard!
That's enough, Narancia!
Shut the hell up!
Narancia!
Abbacchio...
Are we just going to leave him here, Bucciarati?!
Are we just going to leave Abbacchio all alone?!
I don't want to leave him behind!
This is an order, Narancia!
Abbacchio knew that this was a possibility when he came here!
We're leaving.
Bucciarati, wait!
That's...
Bucciarati, wait. Just for a moment.
This must mean something. It has to.
He's holding something.
It looks like a piece of rock from somewhere.
It must mean something. Golden Wind!
Go back to where you came from!
Hey, look!
Apparently, Abbacchio had completed his replay!
This is a death mask!
A death mask from the replay!
Right before Abbacchio's Moody Jazz disappeared...
It took the last of its Stand energy
Abbacchio left us this at the very end!
This is the boss's true face!
Abbacchio, you did a great job.
And your will to get to your truth...
The ones left behind will get it.
Because that's what important.
Special Program Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind destino
Any luck?
Try checking Interpol or even the Sardinian police records.
Do these fingerprints match any records?
It's no use. There are no hits.
Even if the boss had a previous record, odds are he made sure it was erased.
But it has to be somewhere...
That's why he tried to eliminate
Why don't we look through the records of the dead?
The boss might've faked his own death.
Let's give it a shot.
We can't let him get away with this.
A moment ago, just for a little while, I felt the same thing I felt in Venice.
The one who got close to Abbacchio was...
This man finished Abbacchio with his own hands.
Are you saying that the boss is here, Trish?
Yes.
Bucciarati!
Not right now!
If we don't find out the boss's identity for sure
We have to track down his identity first!
No hits.
It's no use... The boss is meticulous.
It's impossible to track him down any farther...
That's not true!
You have already tracked him down.
All that's left now is to find a way to defeat him.
Episodio 29 Get to the Roman Colosseum!
I've been waiting so long
for people like you, who'd do everything they could to track this man down!
Screech
Someone tracked down instead!
Wait! Don't cut me off!
I'm on your side!
You want to defeat Diavolo, don't you?
Diavolo?
Please believe me.
I knew deep in my heart that someone who
That's why I always kept this line open.
I've been waiting for so long...
I waited for years, filled with hope.
I'm on your side!
I don't know about that.
Diavolo?
Just because you said that name
Giorno, cut the connection.
His Stand is able to skip through time!
Did you know that?
Though I'm sure that
He's on our side...
This guy's on our side.
No underling of my father's could've survived knowing his Stand ability.
Be quiet, Trish.
All right. Let's hear what you have to say.
First, tell us your name.
My name doesn't matter.
My body is already in a state that prevents me from fighting.
What's important is whether or not you are actually able to defeat him.
His ability to erase time has no weaknesses.
but you are certain to fail!
Are you saying you know of a way to defeat the boss?
His Emperor Crimson is invincible!
But I do know of a slight possibility to defeat him.
It's just a possibility, though.
You will have to obtain that possibility.
Obtain it?
Come to me. Come to Rome!
If you do that, I can give you this possibility!
Do you really think we'll go to you? We don't even know if we can trust you.
I'm sure at least some of you know what this is.
ech
That's...
At least, it looks just like it!
Why do you have that?
I'll tell you that later.
You must come to my location to retrieve this.
He doesn't know the true way to use this arrow.
This arrow doesn't just awaken Stand abilities in people.
There is hidden wisdom within it.
I will tell you what it is.
Come to Rome.
This arrow will defeat him.
It is your last and only hope!
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
Hey, you there!
What the heck do you think you're doing, answering my phone?!
That call's for me!
Give it here! You stupid brat!
Hello? Yes, this is Doppio!
It's strange, Doppio.
What is, Boss?
Bucciarati and his crew.
They've lost Abbacchio, so they should be at a loss as to what to do now.
But that's not the case.
They've fled with no hesitation whatsoever.
They're on that boat with a goal in mind.
Look into it.
Return to Abbacchio's last location and look around.
Something's not right.
Look around?
Fear is born
This is what I've been fearing
There's nothing suspicious, boss.
The statue's been destroyed, but that it.
I know it. I can tell.
Those traitors... There's no doubt about it.
They figured something out that I don't know about.
They figured something out?
What could it be? They didn't have that kind of time.
It's something that I'd never expect!
That's enough, Doppio.
Go after them immediately.
You have to track them down yourself.
Yes, sir!
Also...
Have them stop Bucciarati and his crew.
I didn't want to ask for help from such filth, but I have no other choice.
This is the last time.
Listen well, Doppio. One must destroy their fear.
The moment is now.
We must get through this right now, no matter what.
That is what it means to be alive.
Who the heck is this guy waiting for us in Rome?
Can we really trust him?
Who knows? But Bucciarati decided we're going.
What other options do we have?
Let me tell you a little story from the past.
In Greenland, there's a place called Cape York where only Inuit people live.
It's famous for having a crater created by a meteorite.
It's said to have fallen tens of thousands of years ago.
In 1978...
Two men from a team that was surveying for natural resources within the crater
contracted an unknown illness.
and eventually, they died looking like tomato sauce.
On top of that, one of them suddenly shot a jolt like a stun gun from his finger
and accidentally burned a few fingers off the doctor treating him.
That virus may have flown here on the meteorite.
A virus?
I tracked it down!
This arrow is made from the same material as the meteorite found in Cape York!
Centuries ago, a man who craved absolute power like that of the gods
found out about this rock and created arrows from it. This is one of them.
This killer virus culls lifeforms.
This is a theory called "viral evolution."
but some possess something that lets them survive.
the virus gives them a new life ability.
This has already been proven, with your own bodies.
So that's what Stands are...
That is the root and principle of that arrow.
I see. I understand that now.
But what's this secret way of using the arrow
I can't tell you that until you come see me in Rome.
On top of that, I can only tell one of you what it is.
Because no one else can ever find out about this secret power.
It is the only way to defeat Emperor Crimson.
There's no guarantee that your story is true.
But if the boss hears about this, he's definitely going to eliminate you.
I'll trust you.
How do you want to meet?
Come to the Colosseum in Rome.
Once you get there, you'll know.
It doesn't matter what time. I'll be waiting.
Everything will be revealed there.
Come on! Get up, damn it!
Shut up! I'm gonna take a piss!
Seriously!
I'm gonna do it!
This isn't the damn bathroom!
There's no toilet here!
This is it, right here.
Damn, that feels good!
I'm gonna do it!
Let's go up on land once those drunks leave.
Then we'll acquire a car immediately.
From there, we'll be in Rome within 45 minutes.
All right, got it.
Perfect timing.
The moon's hidden behind the clouds, too.
Look, Mista.
Damn it! Was there some kind of party tonight or what?
Come on! You're gonna get in trouble.
Come here!
Let go of me!
I said I'm gonna do it, so I'm gonna do it, damn it!
You can't! This isn't a bathroom!
See? It's right here.
Hey.
How the hell am I supposed to reach like this?
How am I supposed to open my fly?
Wh-What the hell is that?!
Don't touch me!
Splash
What'is going on?!
That's a Stand attack!
What?!
They were waiting for us! There's an enemy here!
Listen well, Secco.
The thing you have to worry about most is running out of battery.
Finding out later that it didn't record pisses me off more than anything else.
You sure it's recording?
Excellent.

Cioccolata, 34 years old. A former doctor.
About two years ago, he let a patient die due to a simple mistake.
but the boss found out his true nature after he became a Stand user.
It wasn't malpractice.
He diagnosed countless people who were perfectly healthy
He'd reduce the anesthesia so the patients would wake up during surgery, as well.
Ever since he was a young boy, he had always gotten top grades.
When he was fourteen, he volunteered to take care of the elderly.
However, in reality, he was administering
Also...
Your family hates you.
No one's going to come visit you.
driving people to suicide.
The thing that Cioccolata loved most was to observe people dying.
The reason he became a doctor was so he could observe people's pain and death.
and felt as though he truly understood the psychology of the human race.
Cioccolata's one and only partner was Secco.
The only thing known about him is that he's Cioccolata's former patient.
For some reason, they got along, and Secco only follows Cioccolata's orders.
this duo stands out as a pair of monsters.
That's who Cioccolata and Secco are.
It appears that their destination is Rome, boss.
I just received word that they arrived at a local fishing village.
Listen well, Doppio.
Have Cioccolata stop and eliminate Bucciarati and his crew.
But... you must catch up to those two, no matter what.
Those two... yes.
but Cioccolata is the worst piece of shit on the face of the earth.
He'll probably make a mess of Rome before he's done.
So you think he'll go berserk?
That's why you're going to catch up to them, Doppio.
You must take control in the end.
You're the only one I can trust.
Do you understand? You're number one.
I understand, boss.
That is what I live for.
Sorry, was that call too long?
Thank you very much, little girl.
Um, hewwo?
What the hell is that, Mista?! When did that get on you?
ble
I have no idea!
Find out where the enemy is!
Li'l Bomber!
This isn't good! There are a ton of civilians already down!
The enemy's range is basically the whole village!
They actually involved innocent people in this?
This is going to make looking for the user...
Damn it! I can't tell them apart!
Explain the situation, Mista!
My hand just suddenly bubbled up.
It's almost like mold... It's making my skin rip open...
It looks like it's coming out from underneath my skin!
The same thing came out of the villagers, and their bodies have fallen apart!
Th-This isn't good, Bucciarati!
We can't go up on shore.
There's no way we'll make it up the stairs to the parking lot.
We're better off getting away from the shore on the boat for now.
Are there any signs of breathing on the shore?
There's no one on the shore!
Wait, Bucciarati!
Until we know what attacked, it's too dangerous to move.
I that if we go up on shore, we're gonna be attacked by whatever this thing is!
Giorno!
osh!!
It's on me?!
This is...
Wh-Where the hell is it attacking from?!
M-Mista!
Grab on to me!
Mista! Don't stretch out your hand!
This Stand has something like a switch that gives it the chance to attack!
Chance to attack?
What does that mean?
As soon as I lowered my hand, the attack began!
Come to think of it, it first bubbled up on my hand
That drunk jumped down from the stairs and got attacked.
Splash
The other one had gone down the stairs...
And Narancia had jumped down into the boat.
osh!!
Menacing
So the attack begins when our bodies move down to a lower location?
B-But...
Menacing
Guuush
At this rate, you guys will be...
He's not going down.
He's not boarding the boat to save the other one.
I guess he's already figured out...
exactly how...
Mold...
I've read about this before...
There's a particular type of mold that inhabits the inside of a bug.
Entomopathogenic fungus and caterpillar fungus.
This is very similar to that!
If you move to a lower location from where you originally were, it reacts and attacks!
This is a Stand!
Why in the world would it work like that?
To expand the Stand's range even further!
the corpses produce more corpses.
If the people move a bit further before dying, the mold's range just keeps growing.
That's exactly what they want.
Because the Stand ability is the user's unconscious will.
Climb up, Narancia!
Get off the boat and back on shore!
Mista!
Hurry up! Move forward more!
My foot!
Throw the turtle, Narancia! Throw it toward Mista!
p
Okay, Narancia.
That's perfect. That spot's just fine!

You and the turtle are in the absolute perfect spot!
m
Yee-haw!
Well done, Mista!
As long as we move upward, their attack won't begin.
They made it back up.
All of those bastards made it back onto the shore without a single one of them dying.
Interesting.
Good. Excellent.

You got the footage, didn't you, Secco?
The desperate looks on their faces as they were fighting for their lives?
Good!
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good...
Well done, Secco!
The more curious someone is, the stronger they become mentally.
Humans are far more curious than any other creature, and that's why they evolved.
I can't wait to see it...
I can't wait to see guys like him die.
Oh, right. Forgive me, I'd forgotten.
You get a treat for taking such a good picture.
How does two sound?
Three, you say? You want three sweet ones?
You little glutton.
All right. You can have three.
Here it comes, Secco. Here comes three!
Oh, my bad.
Good!
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good...
You're such a good boy, Secco!
Now, go!
You go to Bucciarati and the others, Secco.
You and your Stand, Sanctuary.
Episodio 30 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 1
What are we going to do, Bucciarati?
We can't go back out to sea.
we're better off finding a car and getting out of this village.
Our number one priority right now is to get to Rome.
Giorno, how's Narancia's treatment going?
It's hard to treat him in this village.
There's living mold in his wounds.
All right, Mista, climbing up is fine.
We're going to go up those stairs and get ourselves a car.
That's a bit cruel, Bucciarati.
He didn't even ask Narancia if he was okay or not.
what did he say?
He coldly ordered you to throw the turtle.
What are you so mad about?
Of course he said that. I was the one who went down into the boat.
It's good that we made it out alive, but because of me, we almost died.
I know that!
What I'm saying is that he's cold to everyone!
Say... I don't really understand how girls feel, but...
Were you hoping he would ask you if you were okay?
but you're dying to know more about him.
Excuse me? I'm dying to what?
Well, getting to Rome is what's most important right now.
You can figure out your feelings later.
I'm really not doing so great right now.
Let me rest for a bit.
We'll be fine.
All the roads are uphill.
And outside the village, there are cars still running.
That means the mold's range hasn't expanded yet.
We just need to acquire a car and get out of this village quickly.
We need to hurry to Rome at all costs.
Which car should we take?
One with a corpse next to it, because that corpse should have the key to that car.
It was just the mold breaking that corpse's hand apart.
I'll watch our rear.
Right.
Mista, I take that back.
Hurry and go up!
R-Right!
What are you doing, Mista?! I told you to go up!
I already am, Bucciarati!
But...
We're sinking!
What's going on?
The whole staircase is being pulled into the ground!
This must be a different Stand user than the one using the mold!
There's another one after us!
This isn't good! We need to hurry and climb up!
If we go down any further, the mold will attack us!
Jump onto the wall!
My gun!
It's not sinking...
The staircase itself is sinking into the ground, like it's melting!
What's that?
The enemy!
The enemy's down below, and he's coming for us!
Mista! Climb onto the wall!
Zipper Man!
om
He's fast... This guy is fast.
And this is strange...
This is a solid stone staircase, but I'm sinking into it...
And this thing is moving around freely underneath the hard ground.
This isn't good! I can't tell where he is!
Where is he coming from?
Can you hear me, Six Bullets?!
Come back to me!
Yee-haw!
They're both making the most of the other's Stand ability.
This duo is too compatible, more so than any other team we've encountered before.
What are they, bound by the red thread of fate? Damn it!
I found one, Bucciarati.
You bastard!
I just caught a glimpse of our enemy!
He jumped from the stairs and dove into the wall!
Th-This is...
Run, Mista!
I'll hold them back! Keep going!
Don't stop, Mista! The ground is still hard!
The bullets are going to ricochet!
our best chance is the moment I get pulled under.
This guy's the powerful, close-range type.
His range is small.
I should be able to see it as soon as it tries to pull me in.
That's when I'll get him!
There! It showed itself!
Now!
Take this!
Mista!
I see...
But you see...
If you're going to deflect bullets, my Bullets can do that, too!
The first three shots I fired should...
What?!
He's not going to finish me off?
So he thinks he can kill me at any time, now that I'm hurt?
Hurry and pick up the key, Bucciarati!
Start the engine!
What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up and get in the car!
If we can actually get out of this village by car, that's fine.
As long as we can all head for Rome.
Where are you going, Bucciarati?!
Wh-What?!
So you're going to track us from underground, no matter where we go?
What a terrifying ability.
But do you have any idea where I'm headed?
Apparently you didn't, huh? You had no idea where we were.
Arri, arri, arri, arri, arri...
Arrivederci!
Squish
Cioccolata
Green Tea
Arri, arri, arri, arri, arri...
Arrivederci!
My...
My...
My face!
What?
Cioccolata!
Three days ago... You heard, right?
The Stand that the boss sent into the airplane... Notorious Chase...
Hey, Secco. Aren't you tracking them down right now?
Hey, Cioccolata... This is important. Very important!
Chase... Is that thing...
Is it alive? Or is it a dead Stand?
What brought this on?
It's a simple question!
Notorious Chase...
Who knows?
But I do know for certain that my Green Tea will destroy any living creature.
The mold doesn't grow on inanimate objects like rocks, right?
Forget about that! Quit wasting time and film those guys dying already!
That's just it, though, Cioccolata!
Look up the hill. Look at the road.
Hey, Secco...
Why is there a car leaving the village?
Is the one driving the car one of them?
Why did you just let them go?
Hey, Cioccolata... It's just unbelievable...
He hit me in the face.
That Bucciarati guy... He didn't have any mold growing on him.
Even though he jumped down!
I can't believe he attacked me there...
It's totally unbelievable!
His body won't grow mold! What the hell is going on?!
I haven't the slightest.
I totally thought...
that you had plummeted.
You scared me, Bucciarati.
Did you hang on to the wall with zippers?
I guess it might've been a close call.
Mista, rest for a bit.
I'll look out for any cars that might be following us.
Right...
Bucciarati, your wrist... Did you hurt it?
Please, let me see it.
Are you listening, Bucciarati?
If the mold got to you, you're in danger.
Please, let me see it.
That's...
Th-That's impossible...
Your skin is so cold...
Giorno, did you just say something to me?
I couldn't hear you.
What's... going on?
Impossible...
O-Oh, yeah... Something similar happened before.
I thought it was just my imagination back then...
Apparently, I hurt myself.
Looks like there isn't much time left.
I'm losing more and more feeling in my skin...
Or...
That's impossible! Don't tell me, back then...
When you saved Trish from the boss in Venice...
Bucciarati, don't tell me... back then...
It's strange.
I've accepted this as fate.
Just a tiny bit of fate, of chance, that Heaven had granted me.
Why... Why didn't you say anything?
My Golden Wind completely healed your wounds back then!
I'm sure it can fix whatever you're going through now, too!
Giorno, I'm sure your Golden Wind
That nothing can be done for those whose lives have already ended.
had already ended.
You won't tell the others about this, right?
That's impossible... But that's impossible, Bucciarati!
Y-You're—
Quiet, Giorno!
There's no car following us.
I hear it. It's getting closer.
It's getting really close!
What?!
Above us! It's a helicopter!
He dropped some mold on us!
Wh-What the hell just happened?!
Bucciarati, we're descending! This road goes downhill!
The mold is going to get us!
Giorno, Mista! We're jumping out!
Grab on to me!
Climb up! Climb up, even if only a little bit!
Subconscious...
In a way, Stand abilities are the users' subconscious abilities...
But whoever this is enjoys cruelty.
That's how his ability became this.
This guy doesn't have any brakes at all!
He has no limits on how evil he can be!
Hey, what's wrong?! I-I'll go get a doctor right away!
Hey, don't! Don't go down that way!
I'll bring a doctor here right away!
Hey, what's going on?
The mold...
That's impossible. There are three million people living in Rome.
This is nothing like that fishing village!
And there are members of the organization in Rome.
This would be a hit to the boss, too.
This guy doesn't care.
He's enjoying this!
At this rate, everyone in Rome will die!
No, this guy's not going to stop, even if it spreads further than that!
There's something else!
At this rate, the mold's killing range will spread to the Colosseum
faster than we can get there.
Mista! Is that helicopter within your gun's range?
It doesn't matter! We have to hit it, no matter what!
Make sure you take it down!
Got it! I won't let you get away!
Go, Six Bullets!
Yee-haw!
The guy in the helicopter wanted me to shoot at it...
So that the guy who can move around underground could safely get to us!
All right, Secco was able to splash down safely... or should I say land?
Now they're cornered.
And whoever Bucciarati and his men were meeting in Rome
will be dealt with by Green Tea.
Th-That bastard's coming from the top of the hill!
And we can't go back down!
Mista, concentrate on the helicopter!
I'll deal with this guy.
I-It's no use, Bucciarati! It's already too far away!
I won't be able to hit the fuel tank or the propellers from here!
No, Mista.
It's no use! They won't reach!
I know the Bullets' range better than anyone.
The helicopter got away!
The bullets hit their target, Mista.
Now, the two of us are going to go take care of the man in the helicopter.
Let's go after the helicopter!
Go after it? The helicopter?
What?! What is this?
We have to take care of him before the mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!
we can leave the guy beneath the ground to you, right?
Go, Giorno!
Run, Mista!
Episodio 30 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 2
my life...
had already ended.
What?!
Above us! It's a helicopter!
Now they're cornered.
And whoever Bucciarati and his men were meeting in Rome
will be dealt with by Green Tea.
We have to take care of him before the mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!
we can leave the guy beneath the ground to you, right?
Go, Giorno!
Run, Mista!
All right! Let's go, Giorno!
Either way...
I'm taking care of you first...
Buccia... rati...
Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 2
Bucciarati...
How dare you ambush me back at that village...
I'm never falling for that again.
How dare you do something so cleaver?!
No, wait...
Something so lever... no wait.
Something so beaver... wait, or was it sever? Griever?
You mean "clever"?
I knew that, damn it! What are you, a language teacher?!
Y-Y-You jerk!
Oh, yeah. I need to record a video.
It shouldn't take me too long to take care of you.
Let's see...
Zipper Man!
H-He's... His power and speed...
I-If we're doing this one-on-one...
Th-This ability...
It surpasses my Zipper Man...
both in speed and in power!
It's recoil. He's hitting the ground with his elbows.
He's using the ground to give him elasticity
That's why he's fast!
Just like a boxer using the ring ropes to increase the power of his punches!
Sanctuary!
Take this! I'm out of time!
even though you fell.
Cioccolata's Green Tea will kill any living creature.
What the hell's going on with your body?
I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize
w-w-with my Sanctuary!
Giorno Giovanna!
I heard that he's a newbie.
He has the ability to give objects life.
The bullets that missed...
The plant that has a hold on this helicopter must be his plant!
They're coming.
Your life force energy is no match for my Green Tea!
I'll rot all of these vines!
We're making this helicopter take off, Green Tea!
Spread your mold! We're breaking free of these vines!
Wh-What?!
I can't take off!
Th-That's not good!
Okay, looks like it's grown to its full size.
It's turned into a tree! Now that helicopter is secured.
Mista! We're gonna climb up the tree to get to the helicopter!
There's no need, Giorno.
Yee-haw!
Go, Bullets!
Your target is his head!
What?!
Mista! The others are saying they can't find him anywhere in the helicopter!
Where is he?! What the hell?!
There's no way he can hide!
He can't get out, either!
Everyone, look for him! Find hi—
Number Two! Number Three!
N-Not good! Mista, hurry and call everyone back! Hurry—
Mista!
Number Two! Number Three! What happened to you guys?!
Th-That's impossible!
Why isn't he here?
Each Stand should only have one ability!
His ability is to attack you with mold if you drop down to
That should be the only one!
Run, Number One...
Number Six! Seven!
We can't... defeat him...
Hurry up and get out of this helicopter!
He's—
...too dangerous!
Mista! Hurry up and call the Bullets back!
Undo your Stand ability!
I can't... I can't call them back...
He got the Bullets...
I-I underestimated him...
Mista!
Mista! Send me over there!
I'll go bring everyone back!
No, it's no use, Number Five.
because he knows Mista won't be able to heal unless he gets his Stand back.
I can't heal him.
N-No...
And he's probably waiting for you to come.
If he manages to destroy you, the final Bullet, Mista will die.
He's someone we should've faced head-on!
Mista! I'm leaving Trish and Narancia here.
Right...
Watch over them!
Mista! Mista...
Follow him... Number Five.
Back Giorno up...
Take this bullet.
Okay...
I feel a life force...
Why couldn't the Bullets find him?
I don't know his exact location, but he didn't leave the helicopter.
In that case...
Golden Wind!
There's no effect?
What is he doing?
How is he hiding in there?
Medical supplies?
He's a doctor?
The aftermath of the mold...
There's no more time! I have to defeat him immediately or all will be lost!
Th-The enemy's true identity is...
Come over here, Number One!
Don't go any closer, Giorno! It's a trap!
What?!
Wh-What the hell is that thing?
Giorno, be caref—
Giorno!
Curiosity...
is the most important factor for mental growth.
I've never been so grateful
as I am right now for all the human experimentation that I conducted as a child.
I made very close observations on what parts of the human body
Of course, I'm quite aware of which veins
need to be closed off to prevent bleeding out, too.
despite being in pieces, and hide wherever I need to.
You can't fall, Giorno!
If you fall any further, the mold's going to attack you!
G-Giorno!
Secco
Sanctuary
Hurry and climb up!
There are times when you truly feel blessed, aren't there, Giorno Giovanna?
I believe there are two situations in which you feel blessed.
The first is when despair changes to hope... You feel blessed.
I was in utter despair.
But I got through it.
I was able to turn that despair around with my experience and mental strength.
And that makes me feel truly blessed right now.
Golden Wi—
Don't you dare climb up here!
Giorno!
Did you forget that both of my legs were still hiding?!
And the second situation that makes one feel blessed...
is when you look down upon someone who's in utter despair!
I've won!
the mold will tear your body to shreds!
Giorno, take this!
Jump in there, Giorno!
Hurry and return to the helicopter!
Grazie, Number Five!
Pound him!
How pitiful.
Nothing's changed, Giorno Giovanna.
I, Cioccolata, am still going to win!
The branch you just grew is also living.
mold will attack that branch!
Jump onto the helicopter, Giorno!
Hurry!
Giorno!
I did it! Now, show me that expression!
Show me despair!
Show me your despair as you fall to your death!
Bene.
Because it was alive, the branch was destroyed by the mold.
the part of the branch that fell from its root no longer holds life.
It's just a piece of wood.
Because you destroyed it, the branch returned to being a bullet.
By the way, all that bullshit about being blessed that you were yapping about...
I can't say I feel blessed at all, even though I'm looking at you.
Because I've been winning against you from the start.
You did it! I can't believe it, Giorno!
That was close!
Please take care of Mista's wounds, too, Giorno!
That was close! Now the rest of the Bullets will be back, too.
Could you move just a little to the right, Number Five?
Huh?
I might just be worrying too much, but... What was his name? Cioccolata?
He might actually be...
You're just pretending to be dead, aren't you?!
And you're thinking.
Giorno?
you can slip beneath the trench and escape.
and you'll win. That's what you're thinking.
To be honest, I have a hole in my right lung right now.
I'm honestly not sure how fast I can get up there.
But my Stand is Golden Wind.
It's a power type with a range of two meters.
If I just take a moment, I'll be able to end you.
H-He's dead! You shot him through the head!
Good point.
but I promise you I won't do anything else.
I'm giving you a choice.
So, what are you going to do?
Stay away from me! Look behind you, you moron!
I've taken Mista and the turtle hostage!
you apparently didn't notice that I snuck my right arm
I'm going to chop off Mista's neck now!
If you come after me, you won't be able to treat Mista!
Mista!
I'm the winner, after all!
Take this!
It's true.
The time I needed to make the bullet that went through
The piece that remained in your head lured the bullet and returned to being a stag beetle.
I imbued it with Golden Wind's life force...
B-But you said... th-that if I stayed still.... y-you wouldn't do anything...
Oh, please.
A piece of shit like you?
Y... You're so mean!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless!
Burnable Trash Pickup Mon, Wed, Fri
Giorno!
Mista's waking up!
Mista! Mista!
What's that doing there?
Was he actually on the phone during the battle?
But with who? What was he telling them?
Why, though? Cioccolata...
Why aren't you answering your phone?
But I'm calling you...
Um, it's flashing...
What's this mean again? Um...
O-Oh, right!
How many do I have? Two! When did he call?
Was it when I was chasing Bucciarati?
It's me, Secco.
I-It's Cioccolata!
I finished off the gunslinger Mista.
Yes!
Now it looks like the newbie, Giorno Giovanna, is trying to climb up to the helicopter.
But it doesn't matter. I win.
You concentrate on Bucciarati.
I'll scratch your back when you get back.
I'm sure you want some sugar cubes, too, don't you?
I'll throw you some.
You deserve a treat.
How many would you like?
Um... Um...
Two?
No! I want more! More! Mooooooore!
I'm only kidding. I'll throw you five.
I'll throw five at once.
Listen well, Secco.
We are invincible.
The strong have the right to rule over the weak.
No, I should say that the strong have a duty to rule over others.
Even if that includes the boss.
I plan to surpass the boss during this battle, as well.
You're going to do this, too, Secco.
Giorno's here. I need to hang up.
But that's why...
I love you.
Let's go.
This should be far enough. I should've lost that underground guy...
Episodio 32 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 3
Sanctuary!
Take this! I'm out of time!
even though you fell.
Cioccolata's Green Tea will kill any living creature.
What the hell's going on with your body?
I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize
every last inch of your body until you can't move anymore...
w-w-with my Sanctuary!
I don't think Ill be able to defeat him quickly.
In that case... I'll lead him away
from here.
Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 3
This should be far enough to lose that underground guy...
There are accidents everywhere!
What's going on?
Look! Someone's unconscious over there, too!
Hurry up and save them!
An ambulance!
Over here!
Under the stairs!
Wh-What's...
Wh-What happened to the mold?!
C-Cioccolata?!
The mold disappeared.
Giorno, Mista...
They must've taken care of the guy in the helicopter.
Secco, it's me. Did you take care of Bucciarati?
Something rather unexpected has happened on my end.
but I've taken a bit of a blow to the head.
So there's something I want to tell you now, just in case.
Listen carefully, Secco.
Their destination is the Colosseum.
I found that out from the Bullets' conversation.
and this mysterious figure knows how to defeat the boss.
and why the boss is trying to stop that from happening.
Listen carefully. Figure out this mystery before anyone else.
You're the only one I can count on.
What's with him?
Wait, that phone call... Was it...
Cioccolata, you piece of shit!
Did you actually think I'd feel sad over you?
You loser!
and you have a lot of money.
On top of that, you're super strong... Or so I thought.
That's why I thought I'd be safe if I listened to you.
But apparently, you're weak after all!
I mean, you lost!
I don't like you anymore, you scum!
I hate your guts!
He knows!
He knows that we're trying to get to the Colosseum!
He intends to figure out the secret!
I won't let you go!
Half...?
Take this! Zipper Man!
What?!
By the way, doesn't "Colosseum"
sound kinda like "kill them" (koroseyo) in Japanese?
Don't you think so, Mr. Language Teacher?
I thought I'd ask before I killed you.
I thought we'd be out of danger as long as we stopped the man in the helicopter.
But things are still getting worse...
The actual threat is this guy who can move freely underground!
If I let him get to the Colosseum before we get there...
He's going to go on a rampage!
You're... a bit annoying... Bucciarati.
You already know... don't you?
At close range, I'm faster and stronger than you!
You're a nuisance! I'll take care of you here and now!
You sure know how to think fast.
You got away again...
Just barely, though.
But your body really is weird.
What the hell is the deal with you?!
You have glass shards stuck in you, but you aren't bleeding much at all.
Did you... see that just now, too?
Hey... What do you think that is?
It came from the second level of arches, right?
There was something shining.
It happened earlier, too.
Hey, something just hid in the shadows.
Was that...
I saw it... I saw a glimpse of it!
The light was reflecting! Someone was looking over here with binoculars!
The guy you're going to go see is definitely there!
He was in a wheelchair, wasn't he?
I think I saw some prosthetics, too!
Is he disabled?
I'm going to find out this secret!
No matter what the deal with your body is!
I'm going to end you, Bucciarati!
Are you mocking me? You went into the ground with your zipper?
Are you copying me?!
Do you think you stand a chance against me
by going underground?!
Take this! Sanctua—
He's not hiding. He's moving.
These vibrations...
He's moving in some direction...
Y-Y-You copycat!
Who the hell do you think I am?!
You and your piss-stained zipper guy!
H-How dare you steal my technique?!
But the only thing that copying me is going to do
is ensure that you basically just doomed yourself!
I won't let you get to the Colosseum!
The surfaces are getting softer...
So he is pursuing me!
But this sound...
This sound that's heading right toward me with no hesitation...
They say that sound reverberates better in liquids than in solids.
It's just like being under water.
Does that mean he can hear when I'm moving, too?
but you can't run from me anymore!
I can tell... I can even tell how far you are from me!
He's 20 meters ahead and to my left.
He moved to the right. Just 10 more meters.
Just seven more meters...
Five meters...
I'm not going to strangle you. I'll bury you alive.
You can die in this grave you dug for yourself, Bucciarati!
You think you can escape my punches
when you're surrounded by walls of dirt?
Just two more meters!
A water pipe?
You cut it to try and trick me?
Seriously?
The fact that you're trying these stupid little tricks
proves that you're feeling cornered!
even with your abilities, when you have to face off with my Sanctuary!
I don't know where you are, but I do know that you're within 20 meters of me.
You're staying as still as possible so I won't be able to find you.
Or what?
Are you trying to come up with some kind of strategy?
I mean, you are pretty quick-witted.
But...
I'll make you lose your upper hand...
You and your quick wit...
That's a different sound than before.
What is this sound?
I'm hearing it from all directions.
The stone pavement inside the ground...
turns to mud because my Sanctuary touches it.
it hardens again.
Say, Bucciarati...
There might actually be a chance.
If you stay perfectly still, you just might make it...
I mean, there's that miraculous story
about the death row inmate who survived three hangings
because of the rope breaking or the gallows malfunctioning!
It's no use... I can't stay underground any longer!
But it's not like I can run along the surface, either!
I'm going to have to destroy the arrow.
Our only hope... is for them to encounter this arrow.
are those who know the true power behind the arrow.
And the one capable of that is not me.
It's them.
Twelve years ago, I acquired this arrow after fleeing Egypt.
And the fear that this arrow brings
will never end until they come.
J.P. Polnareff (36 years old, French)
"Rome will exist as long as the Colosseum does; when the Colosseum falls, so will Rome; when Rome falls, so will the world. (A quote from a certain medieval monk who saw the Colosseum)
This brief history... is rather ironic.
yet they're the ones trying to stop this world from falling into the hands of evil.
But in the end...
Will Bucciarati actually be able to make it here?
There's no point if he doesn't come out the victor.
If he fails, I'll have to destroy this arrow and its secret.
All I can do is wait for them to arrive.
Everything begins after that.
I've been waiting all this time...
just protecting this arrow's true power.
I-It's no use! I've reached my limit!
He moved! He couldn't take it anymore and moved!
Twelve meters to the right. Bucciarati...
He's planning to hide beneath the Colosseum
so he can evade the barrage of stone spears!
That's not gonna happen!
H-He's coming!
I can hear very clearly that he's catching up to me.
I can feel the reverberations! He's ten meters straight ahead!
Eight meters...
He's moving faster than me!
Zipper Man!
You know...
I knew he had something up his sleeve...
Bucciarati, is this the best you could do in your desperation?
Though you are the only one who was able
to hide from my Sanctuary for even a second.
But now you're finished! I'm closer than before. I'll find you soon.
the closer you come to your defeat!
Wh-What...
M-My skin...
Don't tell me...
Even the stone pavement is turning into mud!
It stands to reason that your body
will start turning into mud the closer I get to you underground.
I heard you! You're right there!
Now I've got you for sure. I can tell.
I'm 1.5 meters away from you.
So you've already made it to the Colosseum...
You were so close.
Take this! The secret will be mine!
Zipper Man!
To be honest, I don't really know why, either...
But even after breaking some bones, I barely feel any pain.
My heart has stopped, so I don't bleed very much, either.
The damage to my body is minimized.
That's why I was waiting for this...
I'm sure my eardrums can handle the damage they're about to endure, too.
I was waiting...
for you to drag anything and everything into the ground.
Street lamps, street signs, parked cars...
And the tires on those cars.
Whoops. I guess you can't hear me anymore.
You bastard... N-Now you've done it...
But... This isn't a big deal.
I can still hear!
I could hear that tire popping! I know where you are!
You're right there, Bucciarati!
M-My leg! Wh-Where am...
Wh-Why? Wh-Where is he?!
What did he do to me?!
How did I mistake a car for him?!
Your eardrums have been destroyed.
Your Stand that allows you to travel through the ground...Sanctuary, was it?
it's completely useless.
I figured it out, you bastard!
You're planning to destroy my eardrums, aren't you?!
You think I can't travel through the ground if my ears are destroyed, don't you?!
What a stupid idea!
Stay back!
Stay the hell away from me!
I won't take your life.
I can't let you go, either.
I need you to stay put for a while.
You bastard!
You're trying to put me out of commission, aren't you?!
Stay the hell away from me!
Just stop talking now. This conversation isn't even coherent.
S-Stay away!
Score!
Th-The moment you attack me, I'm gonna turn this kid into mud!
Then I'll throw him at you and run!
You don't wanna kill a kid, do you, dumbass?!
but I'll settle for just reporting this
to the organization and getting a reward from the boss!
It's easier for me to just work for the organization.
Hey, brat! Get me a taxi.
Raise your hand and flag down a taxi for me!
You're going to get one for me!
Hey! Are you listening to me?!
You stupid brat!
Hurry up... and get me... a taxi!
Bucciarati! Why the hell are you moving toward me?!
Can't you hear me?!
Your maximum range is two meters.
I'm very aware of that!
You're probably thinking I can't get away because I hurt my leg!
Don't underestimate me! I'll kill this brat!
You couldn't reach me! I'm out of your range!
You stupid piece of shit!
You just grazed my ha— Wh-What the hell?!
A zipper! Shit, my throat!
there was no way that Bucciarati would sacrifice a kid like me.
Shit! I need to undo this somehow!
Burnable Trash Pickup Mon, Wed, Fri
Ah, Cioccolata!
Cioccolata!
I came here after tracing the signal from Secco's cellphone.
But what's happening seems to be different from the boss's orders.
To think that Secco had already lost...
Since they're a pair, that probably means Cioccolata is also...
It also appears that Bucciarati is here alone.
Where are Giorno Giovanna and Narancia?
Wh-What? My body suddenly... All my strength is...
It can't be... My eyes are blurring, too...
Am I finally out of time?
I knew this moment would come...
But now?
Episodio 33 His Name Is Diavolo
Wh-What? My body suddenly... All my strength is...
It can't be... My eyes are blurring, too...
Am I finally out of time?
I knew this moment would come...
But now?
I must go.
Go? Wait... I know Bucciarati and his crew have a goal.
Where is he trying to go?
I'm sure the boss wants to find that out.
Pardon me.
Can I lend you a hand?
It's totally up to you, though.
What? You're still here?
I'm fine.
I really don't mind lending you my shoulder.
I mean, if you don't mind...
Well...
How far would you like to go?
Um... Just to the entrance of the Colosseum.
The entrance of the Colosseum...
Episodio 33 His Name Is Diavolo
There's no time. Just to the other side of the road... Please...
Look out!
You stupid-ass drunk!
Are you okay?! Where were you look—
What? Why is Bucciarati so cold?
Sorry about that...
Did I run into it?
Could it be that... Bucciarati can't see anything?
He also ignored that car horn when he tried to cross the road.
Does that mean he can't hear, either?
That wound on your throat...
Were you hurt during that scuffle earlier?
Actually, it looks like that wound is from this morning or last night.
It's not bleeding anymore.
He can somehow see it clearly. But it's under my collar...
He's looking right at it!
At the wound that Risotto gave me!
Oh, you picked that up for me.
Well... Ready to go?
Okay... Let's go.
He can hear me, too.
But something seems off, for just being hurt in a fight.
What's going on?
That's Guido Mista!
Damn! I took too much time.
Of course he'd show up.
Is something wrong?
No, um...
Sorry, the cut on my neck started bleeding a little...
He's heading this way!
I apologize for being selfish, but I'm in a hurry.
I need to hurry up and cross.
No!
Don't stand up!
I mean... There's another car coming.
Let's cross once it passes.
No, that's on the other side of the road.
Come on.
N-No... Mista's coming!
I'm just going to have to eliminate him right here...
Right now!
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
I wonder what that sound was.
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring-a-ling-ring-a-ling-ding...
What the hell are you doing?
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring-a-ling-ring-a-ling-ding...
Why am I getting a call right now?!
You're...
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...
You friggin' dumbass!
Trish!
The danger's not fully gone. Get back in the turtle!
You don't understand. here!
I started getting that feeling again.
The same thing I felt in Sardinia...
Who... are you?
The person in front of me...
You're...
Rumble
Trish!
I can feel him! He's nearby.
The boss is nearby!
He's nearby?
You don't know exactly where, though?
He just suddenly appeared...
Thank goodness. You're safe.
Well done. You did excellent work.
This is why you're my most trusted and number one subordinate.
Don't worry.
What do you mean?
I don't know how this happened, but Bucciarati is already a corpse.
His heartbeat has stopped, and he's not breathing properly.
He can't see, and his eardrums ruptured in his battle with Secco.
All he can see right now, Doppio, is the shape of your soul.
All he can hear is the energy of your soul.
and all he can see in cars are the souls of the drivers.
What's wrong, Trish?
My daughter's soul and mine have a similar scent.
That's what I gave you just now.
All Bucciarati sees is the form of my daughter!
Get Bucciarati to lead you to whatever he was seeking.
Have him take you there!
Trish...
Sorry... I'm tired, so I spaced out a bit.
But thank goodness you're safe, Bucciarati.
Yeah... More importantly, was there a young man nearby?
Oh, I saw him rush off somewhere in a hurry.
More importantly, Bucciarati, let's hurry to our destination.
You're right. I hate to bother you, but could you lend me a hand?
I can't seem to gather enough strength...
Diavolo
Emperor Crimson
It's rather small, but Trish, I have a house in the suburbs of Naples.
Once all this is over... if you don't have anywhere to go...
You can live there.
There's a school nearby, as well as a great restaurant.
It's close to the beach, too.
Thanks. But more importantly right now, where should I head next?
Go up those stairs...
Upstairs?
Don't turn your head, Doppio!
Keep going as though you haven't noticed anything!
There's someone here.
Upstairs, behind one of the stone pillars.
Someone is watching you!
It appears that his goal was to meet with someone.
But who could it possibly be? I haven't the slightest idea...
Boss, how do you know they're here?
And if I don't turn around and look, I won't be able to tell who they are.
Look at Bucciarati's eyes. That should be enough.
He's reflecting in Bucciarati's eyes right now.
Don't move!
Stop right there.
Take even a step up those stairs, and our deal is off.
You're right! There's someone hidden behind one of the pillars!
My name is Bruno Bucciarati!
I came this far because I trusted you when you said
I know that.
There's nothing about them anywhere in my records!
And there shouldn't be!
But as you can see, she's one of us.
Trish? That sounds like a girl's name.
Sounds like?
This isn't good... He's going to find us out, Boss!
Calm down. Listen to me. This is what you're going to say:
"Do you have a problem with me being a girl?" Go on, say it, Doppio!
Do you have a problem with me being a girl?!
I guess I said something I shouldn't have.
Is she a Stand user?
Of course! But enough questions! What I want to know is, who are ?
Let's just get to the point of this meeting!
No, not yet. I want to see her Stand.
Trish! Move slowly.
B-Boss...
Who the hell is he?
He's even thinking about a Stand's range...
Who could he possibly be? I really have no idea...
Well? Hurry and show me from that spot.
Move slowly, as if you're lifting up your skirt.
That's... It can't be! Why does he have that?
That arrow... There's no doubt about it.
That's the arrow from back then!
Wh-What's this ominous murderous intent I feel?
It feels like someone's pointing a knife right at my heart...
I've felt something like this before...
Don't tell me—
No, wait... That's right. There is one person I can think of.
He used the arrow to track me down...
He's—
In Egypt, I dug up the arrows that awaken Stand abilities within people.
I knew the moment I saw them
An old woman named Enyaba who had two right hands
Come to think of it, that old woman said something rather bizarre...
In the 90s, me and my old friend Jotaro Kujo were investigating
Jotaro went to America and Asia.
I went to Europe and Africa.
And I managed to find out that one of the arrows was
I investigated an unusual region where drug crimes
and I knew I was finally close.
My organization was nearing perfection after just a few years.
My subordinates swore their loyalty to me.
I had a notion that someone was trying to track me down.
In the end, I would finish them off myself.
I'd already decided that.
But I ended up making two big mistakes.
My first mistake was that this crime organization was already complete.
Communications, the government, the press...
Society itself had isolated me.
And my second and greatest mistake...
Silver Chariot!
I guess I'll tell you, since you're going to die.
The man who had unearthed the arrows
The moment that anyone sees Emperor Crimson...
Boom
This ability...
Time... It...
...they are no longer in this world.
Is there no hope...?
I'm certain that I killed him!
To think that someone I had eliminated
Bucciarati! The one next to you is—
Wh-What? Bucciarati!
Where'd the person next to you go?!
They disappeared! Don't tell me...
Where did they go?!
Where did the one you brought here go?!
T-Trish...
I'm asking you who the hell that person next to you was!
I didn't hear or see anything fall, but a piece is already behind me...
No... These movements...
Time just skipped!
Just like what happened in Venice!
We moved further up the stairs before we realized it!
We're not gonna make it!
This is a test.
I've accepted this test to stand victorious against my past.
A person grows once they are able to defeat their weaker self.
Wouldn't you agree, Jean Pierre Polnareff?
You're...
Rumble
Diavolo!
This is surprising.
How did you get here?!
it doesn't matter how you survived after I scattered your remains in the ocean.
Don't you dare set foot on those stairs!
I'm up here! You're down there!
Why won't you fight yourself, Polnareff?
Because you no longer have the mental capacity for it?
Or are you no longer physically able to fight?
What are you going to use that arrow for?
This is impossible. I'm sure it was a kid down there!
Diavolo... When did you get so close to me?
You're the one below me, Polnareff!
There! Silver Chariot!
I see your Stand ability hasn't lost any of its power.
And it seems you've learned...
I see. In just a moment's difference in number...
Your timing is genius, too.
If I had been any closer, I would've been gravely injured.
This is the worst...
I won't have another chance. But I must...
I must protect hope at all costs!
You're already within my range!
Emperor Crimson!
I've just defeated my weaker self from the past!
Take this! The passage of time will resume—
Wh-What is this?
The arrow... The Stand...
I don't know what it's doing, but...
Take this!
This arrow... What is it doing to Chariot?!
There's some kind of power behind this glow!
Time, resume!
Impossible! What did you do?
This is my gamble to keep the arrow from Diavolo.
You won't get away!
Stab
That arrow is our hope...
The one who can fully control that arrow will be the one to control the world.
I-It happened again! It skipped! Time skipped again!
Trish! Where's the boss?
You spent years uncovering some incredible secret about the arrow.
I guess you held out a pretty long time, Polnareff.
But unfortunately for you, I have the arrow now!
It appears your heart has stopped.
You have been ever so useful... to me.
Giorno!
Hey, he looks really hurt!
Bucciarati!
Be careful! The boss is somewhere nearby.
So you've come...
What?
Who are you?!
How long have you been standing there?!
Episodio 34 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 1
Time, resume!
Stab
What?
Who are you?! How long have you been standing there?!
Wait! Who are you?
What's that mark I can see on your neck?
Wh-What is this? What's going on?
Why did the arrow fall from my hands?
You! I told you to stop!
Show me... your... face...
Why am I sitting down?
He was on top of the wall where Chariot melted...
Could it be... the arrow's...
M-Mista! Something's wrong...
Th-This feeling...
Everyone else is also...
What's going... on...
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.
Episodio 34 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 1
Wh-What? Did I fall asleep?
What... happened?
It's already dawn.
Yeah. I'm not sure why, but it seems like we've been asleep for a few hours...
Wh-What is this?
Is this blood?
Were we attacked?
!
Giorno! Get behind the wall!
You're right out in the open!
If you're hurt, you need to tend to your wounds!
I-Is Giorno hurt? I can't seem to see him anywhere.
Hurry up and hide, Giorno!
Wh-Where the heck is he anyway?
I can't see him at all from where I am.
Could you tell me where he is, Trish?
If he's hurt, we need to go save him!
What the hell are you talking about?
Huh?
Nothing you're saying makes any sense.
Wha—
What the hell is this?!
H-Hey, what the hell is going on?!
N-No, wait! I'm missing something!
It's totally gone!
What I'm missing is way more important!
Hey, Giorno! What's up with the blood on your hands?!
Where the hell are you looking?! You! I'm talking to you!
Y-You're talking to me?
I mean, I was surprised earlier, but whatever this blood is, I don't feel any pain.
It must be from when the mold attacked.
so I think the blood is from my shoulder.
The mold's attack?
What... in the world...
Did I fall asleep?
I feel strange.
Rumble
Wh-What the...
Th-This face...
G-Giorno's body and my body...
No, wait. It's our souls, our minds.
Could it be that while we were sleeping, Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...
Each pair's minds have been swapped?!
Oh, no... I... I...
What's with this face?!
This body!
I stink!
My armpits...
smell so bad!
H-Hey, come on, Trish!
That's not the problem right now!
We were attacked by a Stand.
Why me? No!
but our minds have been swapped for some reason!
Damn it! Could it be another one of the boss's elite guard?
No, Narancia.
Plus, Mista and Narancia mentioned an attack, but is that really what this is?
Our minds have been swapped, but we're not hurt.
What could have...
H-Hey, Giorno.
No matter what happens, I-I'm still older than you. Got it?
Oh, my gosh! I have hair growing on my fingers!
And my nails are so gross and malformed!
I can't deal with this!
I knew it! That stinks, too!
H-How am I supposed to know?!
Probably because we fell asleep near each other.
And is that really what you think about me?
Hey!
What the hell are you touching there?!
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea!
Don't stick your fingers in my panties!
Okay, I got it...
If you spread your legs any further, I'll kill you.
You're even wearing a push-up bra.
Just so we're clear!
I'm going to
curse you to death!
Tch. Don't you get it? That's Giorno.
Stop that!
Hey, guys...
So, Bucciarati...
Um, so it's me and Giorno, and Mista and Trish.
then who did Bucciarati...
I've been watching him, but he's not moving at all.
Is he okay?
Stay away from him, Narancia!
Huh?
There should be someone else inside Bucciarati, too.
And we don't know who that is.
It all comes down to what went down at this Colosseum before we got here.
Who was near Bucciarati?
And what happened to the boss and the man waiting for us at the Colosseum?
Narancia, scout the area with Li'l Bomber!
I've been trying... but...
Something's wrong. Li'l Bomber isn't...
M-My Stand ability...
Appear! Li'l Bomber!
It's no use! Li'l Bomber won't come out!
D-Don't tell me our Stands—
No, Narancia. That's not it.
Take a closer look.
Li'l Bomber!
I-It's so fast! It's so fast, I couldn't even see it!
But what the hell?!
I don't know what's going on, but...
...we're so full of energy!
My Stand is still with me, but it seems to have powered up!
I destroyed six iron railings in a single shot!
My mind is on point!
What in the world is this Stand ability that can swap people's minds?
What's the purpose of this?
This Stand user...
There's no one else nearby.
I can't tell if any of them are the boss.
Everyone around the Colosseum...
is fast asleep.
Even with my radar, I can't really tell how far it reaches.
Some of them are moving just a little bit.
Man, that was a great dream.
Wh-What the hell is this?!
I assaulted some female cop and even handcuffed her.
Tweet, tweety tweet.
Arooo!
Waaah! Waaah!
So all the passersby got swapped, too?
Yeah, it looks that way. There's confusion everywhere.
What a weird ability...
Hey, Giorno. What are you doing?
I should be able to sense a soul's energy through the ground.
But I can't... Who is it?
Who did Bucciarati swap with?
Narancia... I mean, Giorno.
That's not it. That's definitely not the boss's soul.
If it were him, I would be able to sense him.
But the strangest thing is that I'm certain the boss isn't nearby, either.
The boss disappeared somewhere.
Bucciarati...
Until then, we can't take our eyes off of him.
It hurts...
Without question, the enemy is Diavolo.
Got it?!
I-It hurts...
Are you Giorno Giovanna?
Golden Wind!
No... I'm not speaking from inside the turtle.
It's me. I'm the one speaking.
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.
but Diavolo backed me into a corner, and I could no longer fulfill my promise.
Who swapped with who
Mista Trish
Giorno Narancia
Bucciarati
Turtle Polnareff
Who the hell is this guy? Who's "Polnareff"?
Let me just say this first...
I only did this because Diavolo left me with no other choice.
This strange phenomenon that's happening to all of you right now...
is a part of the arrow's power, the arrow I was supposed to give you.
I'm desperately hanging on to my soul... so I can tell you this.
The arrow?
To be more precise, it's because my Stand, Silver Chariot, took hold of the arrow.
My body is already dead upstairs.
The reason I was able to swap souls with this turtle and survive is
There's definitely someone in the hallway on the second floor.
There's a dead guy who's been knocked out of his wheelchair!
It's only my body? Where's Diavolo?
No... I currently don't have the power to control Chariot or make it disappear.
I don't even know where it is right now.
Chariot has basically gone berserk.
Your own Stand went berserk?
No. More importantly, what happened with the boss?
What happened to him?
Where is Diavolo right now?
I don't know.
All of you, listen very carefully.
The arrow is not your enemy, nor is it your friend!
What I'm about to explain to you is hope!
Such a trivial... trivial coincidence happened two years ago.
That's where the trivial thing occurred.
The arrow we had retrieved in Egypt fell between the wall and some furniture.
It's truly an insignificant thing.
Normally, one would just stick their arm back there and pick it up.
But for my body, it was an arduous task.
but I figured that Chariot could get it for me.
That's when it happened.
Chariot hurt its finger on the arrow.
It was mere coincidence.
The arrow draws out Stands from those who have potential.
But if it happens to pierce a Stand...
but I'm starting to understand what the person who created it was thinking.
There's more to the power of a Stand!
Something that goes far deeper!
bugs hid beneath leaves, and cattle laid on the ground.
And the farmers started sleeping in the streets.
I felt a slight change, but a much bigger change had taken over Chariot.
I had a bad feeling, so I immediately took the arrow away from it...
before it could go berserk.
Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had happened.
they would have the power to control the minds of all living creatures!
But I currently don't have that kind of power.
for someone like you who was searching for Diavolo's true identity.
Though, in the end, Diavolo was able to outdo me.
So this controlling minds thing...
It's just swapping souls?
No.
Remember when I said that this was just a part of its power?
I can't control it, so I wasn't able to see its potential beyond that.
But it definitely exists!
Go retrieve the arrow!
The only way to defeat Emperor Crimson
is for you to use the arrow to its full potential!
So in order to take back the arrow, you're telling us to kill Chariot.
Am I assuming too much?
That's fine.
Besides, I've already been finished off.
There's one other unbelievable and important thing that I need to tell you.
Are you the girl called Trish?
Yes, though I currently have hairy knuckles.
I see...
The boss is a duo.
There was a kid who was somehow able to transform into you and trick Bucciarati.
Diavolo and this kid were like a well-coordinated team.
What? B-But how?
But that's impossible.
I'm not sure what happened, either...
If it wasn't for that kid, there's no way I'd have let Diavolo get that close to me.
Two... So the boss is a duo?
What's...
Giorno! Something's moving!
Nine o'clock. Uno signal.
It's a person!
H-He's...
That face!
The boss! No... Diavolo!
Narancia...
Giorno, wait!
The left! Look to the left, in the shadows!
So there it is!
That's my Stand, which the arrow evolved...
Chariot Requiem!
He's—
Th-This isn't good!
Diavolo was looking for Chariot!
He's trying to get the arrow!
Giorno, wait!
Don't attack just yet!
That Stand!
It's Zipper Man!
Th-That's Bucciarati!
It's Bucciarati's...
Episodio 35 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 2
Could it be that while we were sleeping, Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...
Each pair's minds have been swapped?!
Don't attack just yet!
That Stand!
It's Zipper Man!
It's Bucciarati's...
soul!
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.
Episodio 35 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 2
Yes! Bucciarati's okay!
And he was going after the arrow before the boss was!
The way you're talking...
Sounds like it's Narancia who's inside you.
Am I correct?
Yeah!
And you two...
I'm Giorno.
I-It's me, Trish.
Well done, Bucciarati.
You've already figured out this bizarre situation.
That voice... Are you the man we were supposed to meet earlier?
Indeed. My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.
Stab
I was killed by Diavolo.
so I'm just barely clinging to this world, basically as a ghost.
And that is my Stand.
The arrow's power caused it to go berserk, and it is now Chariot Requiem.
That's the reason your souls have all been swapped.
then the one in my body is—
He hasn't woken up yet.
He's still out cold.
Are you... Mista?
Yeah. Glad you're safe, Bucciarati.
is being watched by Number Seven of the Bullets.
He hasn't moved an inch. He's completely out.
Bucciarati!
We already know how to use the arrow.
everything will be over!
Rumble
Gwooooar
Zipper Man... What in the world...
Pick up the arrow!
Requiem's charging at you!
Boom
Boom
Boom
Boom
Stop
I'm gonna knock the arrow away!
Hurry and pick it up!
Something's wrong!
Don't tell me that was...
Take this!
I'll put a hole in your brain!
The pillar next to you!
Mista, duck!
Boom
Spicy Lady!
Smack
Blam
I'll splatter your brains on the ground!
On the ground!
Let the ants swarm around you! The flies swarm around you!
What the... Number One? Where the hell did you come from? Hey, stop!
Cut it out!
Huh?
What's wrong, guys?
What...
It can't be...
H-Hey!
It's going to pick up the arrow!
It's going to pick it up!
What the hell?
I think this is
Requiem's Stand ability when it's in berserk mode.
Now that Requiem has gone berserk, it has carried on my wish
All to make sure it doesn't let anyone else have the arrow!
Anyone who tries to touch the arrow gets stopped by their own Stand!
The arrow has the ability to control your mind...
So then, what the heck are we supposed to do?
Our Stands have powered up.
B-But, I mean...
There, there... It'll be okay.
Mista! Number Seven, the one keeping watch, is freaking out!
Bucciarati's body...
Diavolo? No way!
We'll have to go after the arrow later!
Position yourselves where you can see his body!
Mista! Shoot him now!
What are you doing?! Hurry up and shoot him!
B-But that body is yours, Bucciarati!
Bullet wounds...
are wounds my Golden Wind can fully heal.
We need to make sure he can no longer move.
That's what you're saying... Right, Bucciarati?
He stood up! He's starting to walk!
Boom
Boom
He's convulsing!
No one else is showing up on my radar.
No one's coming to save him!
We did it.
Now, once we get the arrow back... it'll all be over.
Once we get back to Naples, I'm gonna go to school!
I wanna eat some piping-hot pizza, too!
Authentic margherita from back home, where it's baked over an oak wood fire!
I'll get some porcini mushrooms on it, too!
And then...
If I ever see Fugo again...
Too bad Abbacchio's gone now, though...
Trish!
I'm going to protect you until the end!
We all will!
Narancia...
Mista.
Just in case, shoot both of his legs, too.
R-Right!
Trish, you have my bullets.
Give them all to me.
They're inside my boot.
S-Sure...
Hurry up, would you?
Come on, hand over the bullets!
M-Mista...
Time just skipped ahead a few seconds!
Yeah! There are bullets on the ground, but I don't remember hearing them fall!
But that's impossible! I didn't see it at all!
Not him bringing out Emperor Crimson or making it disappear, either!
And why?
He hasn't moved an inch from that spot!
Trish, drop one more bullet from my hand.
Hurry it up!
The number of bullets on the ground is four!
I can't deal with the number four!
If it fell when you handed them to me, then you have to drop another one!
Is he actually Diavolo?
Trish, when we woke up, you mentioned that
What about now?
Do you sense the boss nearby?
But that's not possible!
You swapped with Narancia, and Mista swapped with Trish.
That means Bucciarati switched with Diavolo!
That's Requiem's ability, once it's gone berserk!
Narancia, what's going on in the area?
Is there anyone else trying to come near here?
Narancia?
Trish, please...
You need to drop... drop one more bullet from my hand... please...
I don't know...
I don't know why I can't sense the boss.
I have no idea why!
Move. Move!
I can't sense him anywhere...
Let me through! Please!
Please! Move out of my way!
Impossible! There's no way this should've happened!
Keep an eye on our surroundings, Mista!
Watch our backs!
Narancia!
Cut the iron bars, Bucciarati!
We need to hurry up and get Narancia down!
Leave it to me, Mista! Leave this to me!
You need to load your gun, Mista!
He'll do it again! His attack had already begun!
Zipper Man!
Now heal him!
Hurry up and get the iron bars out of him!
The civilians outside the Colosseum are starting to wake up.
Where is he? I didn't sense any trace of the boss at all!
I don't get why his presence seems to disappear and then reappear anymore...
Emperor Crimson's range is two to three meters, at most.
So then how did he... from over there?
H-Hey! You did it!
Narancia's awake now!
Yes!
Th-That was a close one...
No... Mista.
This is... an empty... shell.
It's an empty shell.
The wounds he received...
But... he's already gone.
Narancia...
It's... completely empty.
His soul...
It's gone.
He's gone now.
There's nothing I can do...
I didn't make it in time...
It's so empty that I could slip right back in... I could coexist in both bodies...
That's just how...
empty this body is.
Narancia!
This is too sudden...
Jean Pierre Polnareff
Silver Chariot
Where is he?
Where could he be?
This is inconceivable!
This can't be possible unless there are two Diavolos!
Two of them...
Don't tell me there are actually two of them...
Rumble
There's only one body, but two minds!
Bucciarati! I figured it out!
Diavolo has two personalities!
That's the only possible way!
The one in that body right now is the kid that I encountered.
The kid and Diavolo have the same body, but their minds are separate!
At times, people's minds
As they grow older, that split can develop into a separate personality.
and one personality will be dominant over the other.
That's the multiple personality disorder theory!
Listen carefully. What I just said isn't a hypothesis.
I've even heard of reports from Germany and England
Requiem's ability tore his soul away from his body.
but the other one...
That's who Diavolo is!
Emperor Crimson attacked from their body!
What are you talking about?
Two personalities?
That's who the boss really is?
Slowly but surely, people are waking up outside.
So I don't know where he's hiding.
But he come again!
He'll attack again, and soon!
That's possible...
But he could've already left the area.
Diavolo is also after the arrow.
He got rid of our radar first.
So we wouldn't be able to tell that he was going after the arrow.
That's why he took down Li'l Bomber.
This just means you'll have to obtain the arrow's power after all.
you need to find the arrow before he does, and get it away from Chariot somehow.
Which way did Requiem go?
To the left.
It looks like people are starting to wake up in the direction he's headed.
Find it? But your body is...
What about your body, Bucciarati?
I missed all his vital points.
But he won't be able to stand up and move.
I made sure of that.
We're going to have to leave you behind here.
So that no one
Ever again.
But I promise
Rumble
Watch out for anyone coming near us!
Let's go!
Trish! What are you doing? Stay close!
Hey, the woman running over there! You're under arrest!
You're going to accompany me to the station!
Kablam
I-Is something wrong, Mista?
Nope! Everything's fine!
but it was just some cop.
It does indeed seem that Requiem
It hasn't even looked at me or the direction its heading.
It hasn't even recognized me as an enemy.
It seems to be slow and even weak.
And it's a fully physically formed Stand.
Civilians can see and touch it.
p
Drag...
Drag
It's no use... It's not letting us get close.
It's not just our Stands.
This arrow might truly be invincible.
The more difficult this becomes, the more I'm convinced that it has
It's getting up again.
How can we pick up the arrow?
It's right in front of us!
Hey.
Requiem won't allow Stand users to pick up the arrow.
But what if someone who's not a Stand user tried to pick up the arrow?
Well, what do you think will happen?
Why are you asking me that? How the hell would I—
Rumble
H-Hey, guys!
My soul is holding on for dear life within this turtle.
I'm no longer a Stand user...
so I was able to touch it!
Mista! Hurry up and pierce your Stand with this arrow!
Episodio 36 Diavolo Surfaces
So there you are... Boss...
That's where... you were...
And that's... whose body you're using.
you said you had to go because things were going south...
It's true...
But...
I'm so lonely...
Could you... call me again...
Boss...
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.
Episodio 36 Diavolo Surfaces
Mista! Hurry up and pierce your Stand with this arrow!
What's going on? Requiem's suddenly heading toward us.
Giorno! Stop Requiem!
I can't! It's too far away!
Crack
Wha—
My gun...
What are you doing, Mista?!
It's because you're touching the arrow!
No way! Why is this...
Let go of it, Mr. Polnareff!
Let go of the arrow!
Glad I took that cop's Beretta just in case.
But what the hell, Bullets?
Why'd my revolver break all of a sudden?
M-Maybe the boss got close?
You dumbass! Think before you talk, Number Five!
Are you saying you saw someone coming close to us in this big, open space?
We didn't see anyone at the moment the revolver broke.
It's metal fatigue.
The axis of the cylinder broke.
We haven't had a chance to do any maintenance or inspections!
H-Hey!
What the hell is this thing's problem? It's heading toward m-me!
No, Mista. It's heading towards me.
Even though it has the arrow back...
Golden Wind!
Batoom
Requiem intends to finish me because I touched the arrow.
Mista, run!
Reload, Bullets! Reload the gun!
This isn't a revolver! We need another cartridge!
It'll take time to reload it!
I-It's no use...
I'm throwing it! Catch it, Giorno!
I'm gonna throw the turtle to you!
Mr. Polnareff!
You okay, Mr. Polnareff?
He's okay. B-But... how?
Mista, do you remember what I said back at the Colosseum?
There's still more to Requiem's ability that I'm not aware of.
But I'm starting to understand.
Requiem stopped because the starting time has come.
The starting time?
Yes.
It's because
That's why it stopped trying to kill me!
This is Requiem's true motive, now that it's gone berserk.
meaning the ability that makes them start to change into something else.
The 4.5-billion-year history of this world's creatures is starting to change
into something else within a matter of hours.
All of it!
I see...
However...
Thanks to them, I was able to see it.
I'm starting to understand the answer.
I'm close to figuring out how to get that arrow from Requiem!
I'm realizing the method!
Wh-What the hell is going on?
What's up with this ability?
How far has this damn thing spread?
It doesn't look like they're dying or in pain...
Everyone just has these vacant stares.
But there is this fear of becoming something else.
The fear that, slowly but surely, both my body and my soul are going to disappear.
Trish!
I-I'm fine. But...
The starting time is imminent.
We don't have much time left...
Polnareff! This is happening because you brought the arrow!
but instead, you basically ended us!
Stop! This is far beyond anyone's expectations.
It's more important that we find a way to defeat Requiem.
That's right. Good. Get closer.
Get closer to Requiem!
If we get closer, I'll be able to fully see Requiem's secrets, because I'm right here.
The arrow's power will become mine, and the world will grovel at my feet!
After it!
Good!
Don't move, Mista!
Trish, Bucciarati! Both of you stay where you are!
Stay right there!
Wha—
I just told you not to move, Mista!
We can catch up to Requiem in a second!
What the hell? Shut up, you dumbass!
My body's disappearing already!
I picked up your revolver.
The one that you said broke a moment ago.
This broken part doesn't match up correctly with the rest of it.
If it just broke due to metal fatigue, they should still fit together.
What are you getting at, Giorno?
Bucciarati, I need you to stay right there, too!
We need to keep a distance from each other!
You dumbass! Requiem is getting away!
The Bullets said it was metal fatigue, so it's metal fatigue!
I have a new Beretta, too!
The parts aren't matching up because a piece flew off!
That could be...
But it could be something more.
We'll be able to tell as soon as we see this lost piece.
Golden Wind.
Moles are basically blind, but their sense of smell is unparalleled.
Looks like it's returned, and it found its lost piece.
Fit
H-Hey, wait a sec!
Listen up! The Bullets and I are very clear on this!
There's no one who got close to me in this square—
You're exactly right. No one did.
Giorno, you...
No one got close to Narancia when he was attacked, either.
No one... other than us.
then he should be able to get in and out of another's mind freely.
Diavolo has inhabited one of us.
Wha—
If he stays hidden, Trish can't detect his existence.
The reason he's staying hidden now
That's why he also appeared for a brief moment to destroy the gun.
W-Wait a second!
I know I keep saying this, but stay away from me, Mista!
Stay out of his range!
My gun was destroyed!
You're the one closest to the gun.
I-It's...
It's not me!
O-Oh, yeah. When Narancia was attacked...
The one closest to him was...
Shit. I must do something.
Requiem keeps moving farther away.
This rookie, Giorno Giovanna...
He's hiding in one of us.
But despite that, we have one advantage.
If he had total control
of the body he's currently inhabiting, he wouldn't just stay quietly hidden.
It's because he can't manifest and move around freely
In a sense, we have him cornered.
It's the turtle!
Polnareff is the one who's possessed!
That's not possible.
because the boss destroyed the revolver.
The boss won't let the body he's inhabiting be put in danger.
Plus...
I only sense one being's life force.
This turtle only has one soul in it.
You can tell that, Giorno?
Only if I can get closer and touch their body.
How can you be so certain?
Life force is a mass.
If I actually touch someone, I can tell how many there are.
There's no other way.
But how are you going to get closer within Emperor Crimson's range?
I learned how to detect Emperor Crimson from Mr. Polnareff.
The moment the droplets suddenly increase is when time has skipped!
Correct.
as is whether you'll be able to just barely dodge it.
It's definitely not me.
When Narancia was killed, I was the farthest away.
Then I'll check you first so we can be at ease.
Hey!
Stop right there! Stay away from me!
D-Don't come any closer!
If Diavolo is actually in you, what's going to happen to me?
When Narancia died, his body was empty.
but it was empty.
There's no chance that he's possessing me.
Oh, really?
That's just what you're saying.
I have no way of confirming your ability.
You can't check yourself with your own ability, can you?
Mista, we can't go after the arrow unless we find out!
Come any closer and I'll blow your limbs off!
Stop!
Check me first, Giorno.
Hurry up and do it!
We're losing more and more time.
There's no other way.
We have to do this right now.
Someone's going to be attacked...
If we get closer to one another...
Slice
Giorno!
It's Mista!
Spicy Lady—
No, Trish!
It's you!
He got closer instantly by moving your body closer to him!
I've been waiting for this moment, my daughter...
The moment you unleashed your Stand!
Diagram of swapped souls

His body has died (which means Doppio has also died)

Giorno
Turtle Polnareff
My daughter...
If you hadn't revealed your Stand, I might've actually been cornered...
Zipper Man!
If I can grab the Stand, I can also move the body.
Now I can at least make this body run.
We're going to be attacked! Brace yourselves!
He's going to make time leap—
Wha—
D-Don't tell me...
Why's he running without attacking us?
Through observation, he's already found
a way to get the arrow away from Requiem!
There's no time! That takes priority!
Shoot, Mista!
Don't let him get there first, no matter what!
Stop wasting time!
This isn't the time to hesitate because that's your own body!
That's not it...
It seems that... I've already fired six shots.
He's running as he makes time leap!
He predicted the course of the bullets!
After him! If he gets the arrow, we're finished!
That shadow...
If I'm correct...
Which means...
To that man, it should look like the shadow is stretching toward me.
In Bucciarati's eyes, the shadow is stretching in front of Requiem.
Which means...
This shadow is in different places depending on the viewer!
This is the mystery of Requiem!
This is why it can control everyone's souls!
This thing is the shadow of one's soul.
Requiem itself is the shadow of my soul!
That's why attacking it will mean attacking yourself!
If we can get rid of this shadow, I can get the arrow!
And...
He still doesn't have the arrow!
We're rushing in, Mista!
The light is behind my own mind!
He just destroyed something behind his head!
What in the world did he do?
Now I've got it...
I, Diavolo, now have the arrow!
If Diavolo found a way to grasp the arrow, we should take advantage of it.
Because the arm he tore off of me and these droplets of blood are all just particles.
Golden Wind shall now
appear!
These ants!
What just happened?
This is good, so far.
Let's go...
Blast the arrow away from him! Don't let him grab it, Mista!
I'm already shooting!
They made it through!
He can only knock the ones coming at him out of their trajectory!
The rest of you knock that arrow back and bring it to me, Bullets!
H-He'd already thrown...
...a civilian into the air!
He figured out the bullets would land and returned the arrow to its place!
The trash ability of an underling...
There's no way your weak mind can surpass Emperor Crimson's predictions.
You will not be able to get through.
You're still just trash.
your team has made me sweat.
nor did I ever think you'd find out my true identity.
But the fact that I've been able to figure out this arrow's true power is a blessing!
It's a gift granted to me by fate because I was able to defeat my past!
I need ammo, Bullets!
We told you, Mista!
It takes time to reload that cartridge!
We're finished!
Wh-What in the world?
Spicy... Lady...
You didn't deflect Mista's bullets.
I just made them softer.
and I had them use their elastic force to return and blow through it.
Trish... You're still conscious!
I'm going to overcome this.
I'm not going to live in fear and run away from the fate
If it's in my way, I'll just climb over it!
The arrow's flying toward me!
I'm the closest!
He can't get past me!
I'm still closer to it!
if only you hadn't been born...
Fear truly does come from the past.
You have genuinely angered me!
What?
Booooom
You said you'd overcome this, did you not?
You were right, Trish. Now you can surpass not only the past...
but their heads.
Trish!
Episodio 37 King of Kings
You bastards! Don't turn your backs on me!
Time to face my Hamon Bubble Launcher!
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 15: A Hero's Proof
Th-This couldn't be...!
Great! He's a nuisance, but at least his Hamon works!
You're surrounded by my bubbles. Here's the bombardment!
H-He popped your Bubble Launcher!
Those wires on his head didn't pop my bubbles.
It was the wind they created.
That means those wires are anti-Hamon weapons!
They know the principles of Hamon!
- Wamuu -
They've met with Hamon before, over 2,000 years ago!
- Esidisi -
- Kars -
What is happening to the air around them?
No, Caesar! Get down!
Wh-What the...?
Close your eyes!
Caesar!
The Hamon tribe.
I thought we eliminated them all 2,000 years ago.
But here they are in Rome, waiting for us to awaken.
Damn...you...
You killed my dear friend.
You think losing an eye will stop me?!
Wh-What's so damned funny?!
The Hamon tribe always says the same thing.
It was the same when we crossed from
You think losing an arm or an eye will stop me?!
How dare you take my friend's life?!
That's why we laugh.
Y-You monsters!
Let's go. We must find the Stone.
G-Get back here!
You're running away?!
Your throat and lungs are your weak points.
We know that if you can't breathe, you can't use Hamon.
Now I'll say what I've always said.
Come and face me again when you are stronger, boy.
When we meet again, I want to admire your strength...
...before I utterly destroy you.
It seems there are no other Hamon users.
Let's move.
Here! Look here!
Don't go and overlook me, now!
He only cut your eyelid. Your eyeball is just fine.
Take your little Bubble Launcher and hang back.
I'll take care of this.
JoJo!
It's time to show off the brand new technique
What?!
Let me introduce myself.
I call this the Hamon Clacker Volley.
I start off by filling these clackers with Hamon.
Oh, no!
JoJo, what are you doing?! This is no time for foolishness!
My friend just died! You're completely senseless!
Me? I'm dead serious.
Caesar, you mourn the loss of your friend.
I feel your pain and anger.
But more than that, I can't stand egotistical jerks like these guys!
I'm not an expert yet, but see what you think of my Clacker Volley!
I hate to say it, but my Hamon is still weak.
But I can use these steel clackers to break your skin
That should even my handicap.
Pretty good, right?
Take this!
Let's go.
This is absurd.
Perhaps humans have regressed over the years.
Regressed?
Perhaps so.
JoJo, stop monkeying around!
You just tossed metal balls at them!
JoJo might be serious. He'd be fine if he was facing a street punk.
But these guys are way out of his league!
It's silly enough to make me cry!
Blast it! Nobody here takes me seriously!
Hold it, big guy! You're gonna get hit!
Don't.
Human lives are short enough. Do not rush to die.
Spaghetti al nero di seppia looks bad, but it's a real treat.
You need to try my Clacker Volley before you judge it!
The clackers vanished!
I've been working on the railroad, All the live-long day.
L-Look!
Gotcha! Still fooled?
If you don't get it...
...let me show you!
Take this!
Those moves are impossible!
And he's even faster than Santviento!
The clackers didn't even touch him!
I admire your weapon, courage and idea.
This is becoming fun.
Thus...
I'll give you one minute.
I bestow on you a single minute to fight the mighty Wamuu.
JoJo!
As you see, I've cut your wrist.
Your wound gives you one minute of consciousness to stop the bleeding.
Give me everything you've got!
Here is what I say to the Hamon tribe.
Here is an hourglass measured in blood.
Wamuu, we'll be outside.
Boy, go pick up your weapon.
Huh? What was that you said?
Go pick up your weapon? Is that what you said?
I don't need to do that.
There's no need to go pick it up.
That was my Clacker Boomerang!
One minute is all I need to end you.
Make fun of me, will you? I'll smash you to pieces!
Then I'll fill you with Hamon!
Very well.
Hit me all you like.
You are the first person to scar my face.
And so I bestow upon you this honor before you die.
You say no one has ever hit your face before?
Big words!
You didn't even notice when you killed Mark!
I'll make you regret holding your nose so high!
Look out! He's up to something! That arm of his isn't broken!
Th-This is gonna be bad!
It was wise of you to jump back.
I let you hit me to punish myself for my lack of caution.
But that has ended.
JoJo, finish him now!
My ultimate technique.
The Divine Sandstorm!
I-I'm in trouble!
He spins his left arm clockwise!
And his right arm counterclockwise!
JoJo is caught unaware, and Wamuu's fists seem to grow before his eyes!
The space between his fists becomes a destructive vacuum!
The whirling creates a microcosm of wind and sand!
H-He ripped through that marble pillar like a piece of old cloth!
I've never seen such power!
JoJo...
That was my Divine Sandstorm.
Jo-JoJo!
No, stay back!
Mr. Speedwagon, you have to run!
I'll do something to hold him back!
The blood in my eye threw off my aim.
But it was enough, even when you hid behind the pillar.
Dead already?
Ordinarily, I would ignore humans like yourselves.
But you witnessed my shame, so I must be rid of you as well.
Prepare yourselves.
I'm imagining things.
H-He couldn't be...!
U-Unbelievable. He's trying to escape!
Playing dead like that. He's got no shame!
I can understand leaving me, but Mr. Speedwagon?
That guy is the biggest menace I've seen!
My breathing is out of control. I can't use Hamon!
All that's left is my specialty.
All I can do is run!
Look at our dismal hero!
JoJo is on the ground, forced to play dead.
And he's about to leave Speedwagon to his fate!
Even so, JoJo will remain the worthy hero of this tale!
Here's why!
Still alive, are you?!
You coward.
You thought you could trick me and escape?!
I only needed to fool you for a dozen or so meters.
I just wanted to get to this minecart.
So you only acted like a coward to lure
And you fell for another of my tricks.
Get out of here now, old man!
Caesar, you too!
JoJo...
That chivalrous bastard...
I've sure painted myself into a corner.
I need to come up with something.
Can I get a break?
An unbending hero!
Only when JoJo loses the will to fight
JoJo!
Damn him! He's far more injured than me!
He may put on a foolish act, but he takes his fate seriously.
He knows he has to beat those monsters!
You speak quite brashly for one in such a terrible state.
You're a tough one.
Weak-spirited, but tough indeed.
How are you so tough?
Do you have bricks for brains, or do you have another trick for me?
You want to know?
Don't tell me.
Is it something stupid like going into
Oh, no! He knows!
Or do you plan to pull the brake and send the minecart flying?
Something like this?
H-He did it again!
The time on your wristwatch is almost up.
There is no chance you'll survive this.
You have no more tricks.
But tell me this.
Why don't I see defeat in your eyes?
You want to know?
You really want to know?
Forget it. I'll just kill you now.
If you give me a month, I'll become strong enough to beat you.
What was that?
Give me a month and I'll outdo you.
I'm the first person to scar your face.
If I put my mind to it, my potential is limitless.
No, never mind what I said.
Well, finish me quickly.
It's an honor to be killed by a warrior like you.
Continue.
Oh, I'm tired of talking.
Make it painless, Wamuu.
I told you to continue!
JoJo is still okay!
You have a long life ahead of you.
You'll have to carry the shame of being scarred by a human.
The only way to fix that is by beating
What? Don't feed me your lies, JoJo.
I've hooked him! Just a bit more!
He called me a coward when I ran.
Using a word like that means he's the proud warrior type.
I can use that against him!
I'm rather new to fighting.
But you have a chance to kill me
Why you...?!
Wamuu.
Master Esidisi.
His minute is up. Why do you let him live?
Crap, we've got company!
Master Esidisi, I've grown fond of this wielder of Hamon.
I-I got him!
JoJo!
I agree to your proposition.
You won't kill me?
That's right.
We'll fight again?
That's right.
This is a bad idea. You'll regret it.
Yes! I'm safe for now!
However...
I need to ensure that you will not simply run away.
Wamuu, will you use that old thing again?
The Wedding Ring of Death.
I will put this ring around your aorta.
Wh-What are you doing?!
The ring will start to dissolve in 33 days.
Inside is a virulent poison.
The ring cannot be removed.
You have only one way to avoid the poison.
Fight and defeat me within 33 days
JoJo!
Till death do us part. A true wedding ring.
Midnight in 33 days at the Colosseum. I'll be waiting, JoJo.
You guessed wrong if you thought you'd escape.
I don't imagine we'll fight, but here's a little gift!
I'll put it around your windpipe!
My heart and throat!
Mine is a different poison from Wamuu's.
Kars, do you want in on this?
Nonsense.
We are immortal.
A worthy opponent is a rare thing that gives our lives meaning.
I can see why you do this.
But our goal is to obtain the power of the Red Stone of Aja.
Do not forget that, you two.
Let's go!
JoJo, grow strong and overcome my Divine Sandstorm!
H-Holy smokes.
A wedding ring?
And now I've got two of them.
Do I look like a bigamist or something?!
Well, at least Speedwagon and Caesar are safe.
There's no sense in moping about it.
JoJo.
You damned fool.
Despite your blood loss, you pulled
Good show.
Let's study Hamon together.
We'll grow stronger.
You and me both.
Next episode
I only said one month as a bluff!
Step through those doors and you'll see.
Coach, no!
I won't hold back because you're a girl!
Welcome to Venice!
Chapter 16: Lisa Lisa, Hamon Coach
if only you hadn't been born...
Fear truly does come from the past.
You have genuinely angered me!
What?
Booooom
You said you'd overcome this, did you not?
You were right, Trish. Now you can surpass not only the past...
but their heads.
Trish!
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.
Episodio 37 King of Kings
T-Trish!
No way! He...
He attacked! He went through Trish's mind... and into himself!
I guess I don't need this body anymore...
or you.
H-Her soul!
It's moving away!
Trish's soul is...
disappearing into the sky!
The arrow!
The arrow belongs to me!
It pierced me!
The arrow's power... This gift given to me by fate!
Now my Emperor Crimson will sit atop the world again!
Did it pierce me?
I-It didn't!
Wh-What... Something is wrong!
No... I can't even grasp it!
E-Emperor Crimson's hand is translucent!
And it's crumbling!
What?!
Th-This is...
My soul is leaving her body...
This wind is...
I-It can't be!
are the movements of arrows and bullets?
You couldn't seem to predict what I was going to do.
Y-You bastard...
You're the one who discovered the way to destroy Requiem.
This thing behind our heads...
Or rather, this thing that's behind every one of our souls.
It just needs to be destroyed.
Don't... Don't, Bucciarati...
but if I completely destroy mine...
The ability of Requiem, the Stand that lost control, will disappear.
Don't, Bucciarati!
Look at me! Think about who's truly worthy!
Bucciarati... Y-You're...
Who is the king worthy of possessing this arrow?!
Bucciarati! The weak are not worthy to possess the arrow!
All the souls that have been swapped...
will return to their original bodies!
Trish's soul!
I-It's Trish!
Mista!
Everyone, look!
You did it, Bucciarati!
It was a close call, but she's returning!
I'm leaving the rest up to you, Giorno.
B-Bucciarati...
Y-Your body's back at the Colosseum.
That body is—
Giorno, I was reborn.
When I met you back home in Naples...
When I betrayed the organization...
My soul had been fated to slowly die, but it was reborn...
Thanks to you.
This is what true happiness is.
This is how it should be. Don't worry.
Please give everyone my regards.
How dare you?!
All for a stupid little girl!
You vile pukes that some loser spewed into a toilet!
Who do you think I am?!
I, Diavolo, shall be the one to possess the arrow!
W-We did it...
Way to go, Bucciarati...
That was a close one...
but Trish will be okay now.
Giorno... You need to heal us.
Bucciarati's still at the Colosseum, but I'm sure he'll be here in no time...
Right?
Don't worry about it, Giorno.
I'm only going back to where I was supposed to go.
I'm simply returning to how I once was...
That's all...
Jean Pierre Polnareff
Chariot Requiem
Benedict!
I don't remember who said it, but...
"We are all soldiers chosen by fate."
But there are truths I've learned from this world, as well.
Fate has given me the ability to make time skip, and to predict the future.
There's no doubt about it. That's the undeniable truth.
The fate of this world
was supposed to have chosen my Emperor Crimson to stand invincible at the top.
I am no soldier.
Damn it!
And despite that, somehow... that arrow is not in my hands!
How dare you?!
There's no way...
There's no way that I, Diavolo, would lose like this!
I need to retreat for now.
I need to hide from the arrow and await the ideal moment for my counterattack!
Retreating here is not admitting defeat.
I have the ability to take myself back to the top!
Don't let him get away, Giorno...
No matter... what you do...
If he gets away, he'll go into hiding.
He's planning to run away, Giorno...
I just felt it... He took a step back!
Wha—
He's holding the arrow!
The one who will control the arrow after Requiem...
is Giorno!
It's no use... There's no way I can escape from here after all!
I'll lose my pride if I flee from them.
I am a king!
My only goal is to remain at the top!
If I flee now, my pride will be lost!
There is... no next time!
He's not running away!
despite how pointless that is!
Golden Wind!
He did it!
The one who will go beyond the power of that arrow is Giorno's Golden Wind!
No! You're wrong!
I thank you, my daughter!
I was able to keep my pride!
Thank goodness I didn't retreat.
If I had fled, I wouldn't have seen this premonition.
This unexpected premonition from Emperor Crimson Eulogy!
Golden Wind!
He did it!
The one who will go beyond the power of that arrow is Giorno's Golden Wind!
B-But why?
It went through him... but the arrow's on the ground.
I'm so glad I didn't run away. So very glad!
To be honest, my heart was filled with despair.
I wouldn't have decided to advance on you.
I saw a premonition of the arrow falling to the ground!
Giorno Giovanna... You weak little newcomer...
This means that you weren't a suitable vessel.
He's already disappeared, but remember what Polnareff said?
The arrow decides who is worthy to wield it.
I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm truly glad I didn't run away.
You've been rejected by the arrow!
Giorno, run!
You're finished!
I, Diavolo, will be king, just like I've always been!
G-Giorno!
Mista, wait!
The thing that's peeking through the crack...
Could that be...
Th-That's...
What am I looking at right now?
I cracked his head open!
Shouldn't I be seeing his brains spilling out right about now?
What came out wasn't brains...
Th-This can't be!
And the arrow's being sucked into his arm!
The arrow—
Shit! You're finished, Giorno Giovanna!
Th-That's...
Giorno wasn't rejected.
He wasn't cast aside by the arrow because he was unworthy!
No... In fact...
The arrow is forever Giorno's!
The boss can never have that arrow now!
Am I looking at reality?
I must be seeing some kind of mistake.
I should be looking at Giorno's corpse, with his head cracked open!
This cannot be reality!
It's Requiem...
That's Giorno's Requiem...
Golden Wind Requiem!
Golden Wind has gone beyond the power of the arrow!
What?!
The only thing that will survive is the truth of this world.
Righteous actions born of truth shall never be destroyed.
but their actions and wills have not been destroyed.
They handed this arrow to me.
or are they merely superficial, born of evil?
We're about to find out.
Can you avoid destruction, Boss?
Wh-What's going on? What's about to happen?
Don't tell me our souls are going to be swapped again!
I don't know... No one does.
Giorno probably doesn't, either.
But given what just happened, I know that Giorno has complete control of Requiem!
It hasn't gone berserk!
I couldn't see it... I couldn't see the moment he attacked!
But I was able to predict that attack.
The reason it didn't fully hit me is because
I was able to predict the hole appearing in my hand!
I can dodge his attacks, though just barely.
It's true that this Golden Wind's attack yielded tremendous power...
But... that's all it's worth.
It merely powered up.
It's a threat, but I can still predict it!
This is not something I can't overcome!
Fate has chosen me as the one to stand at the top!
I am the king who has overcome all threats!
Don't talk to me like you have any idea what's going on, Giorno Giovanna!
I won't even give you the chance to regret your death!
Emperor Crimson!
Time shall be eliminated for everyone but myself!
I can see it... I can see his Stand's movements!
I can perfectly see what it's trying to do!
I can estimate what these pieces of trash are going to do!
That should fully stop Golden Wind's movements!
your eyes will never be able to see myself or Emperor Crimson again!
The pinnacle of truth lies within my abilities!
Yes! I've won!
I'm just a moment quicker!
I've completely ripped out his heart in my premonition!
The future has chosen the actions of my Emperor Crimson!
This is the end!
Wha—
What?
Don't tell me this is...
Is the time that I disposed of reversing... because of Requiem?!
N-No! Everything is returning to normal!
But my premonition still favors me!
Take this, Giorno Giovanna!
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
Wha—
What is this?
What am I seeing?
A-Am I dreaming?
Am I witnessing some kind of illusion?
No... that can't be true.
The only one who can move within the time I've disposed of is me!
This is... Requiem.
What you're seeing is indeed the truth.
but you will never arrive at the truth that's going to happen.
regardless of their abilities.
This is the power of Golden Wind Requiem.
This is unknown even to Giorno Giovanna, who controls me.
Giorno Giovanna!
I won't even give you the chance to regret your death!
What am I saying?
I-I...
haven't moved at all from the start!
Th-This premonition that I had... It's the truth that's going to happen!
My invincible Emperor Crimson should be heading toward victory!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Episodio 38 Golden Wind Requiem
Come on, guys! Hear me out!
Would you cool it already? Okay, what do you want?
I was thinking about this last night...
So, if you were to eat human flesh, would it taste good or bad?
Come on, Mista. Don't talk about stuff like that.
Why the hell would you bring that up out of the blue?
Get outta here! Go eat by yourself!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Scrunch
Kapow
You won't be heading anywhere.
In particular, you will never arrive at the truth.
Why, you little brat!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless!
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.
Episodio 38 Golden Wind Requiem
Y-You did it! At last!
Your Golden Wind evolved with the arrow, and...
but you finally defeated him!
But... wait a sec.
Hey, where is he? Where's his body?
Damn it!
Where is he?! Find him, Giorno!
Where is he?!
I'm just...
But...
My prediction clearly showed my victory... and yet...
What in the world... was that Requiem?
I need to escape... into this sewer for now...
I still... have enough strength left for that...
I did it...
Was I just lucky?
You jackass!
I-I'm not g-gonna let you s-snatch my precious c-coat!
It's not happening!
What? You wanna fight?
Well, do ya?! Don't mess with me!
I'll take you on anytime!
Come at me, ya dickhead!
What?!
Come on! Come at me!
I-Impossible!
This can't be...
You're never gonna get my coat!
S-Someone...
You ain't getting it...
I-I can't... Not here...
You ain't getting it...
I-I'm Diavolo!
Not at the hands of a guy like him...
I'm fading...
Where am I?
Why am I sleeping on a bed?
I fell into the river, and then, when I got into that sewer...
Let's see... Today's date is the 25th.
File number 68.
I, Dr. Monica Ultello, will be handling this case.
We have an adult male, between the ages of 30 and 40.
His identity is unknown.
Judging from the state of his skin, it's been about 48 to 54 hours since his death.
I will now begin the autopsy to determine his cause of death.
Hey, woman... What are you talking about?
Where am I? What am I doing here?!
Hey, woman!
I can't move...
M-My fingers...
My body...
What in the world is...
Hey, woman! Are you listening to me?!
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing?!
Why won't my body move?!
A-And this pain...
I-It hurts!
The cause of death is a stab wound reaching his liver.
There are no marks indicating hesitation, so we can rule out suicide.
Next, I'll dissect his abdomen and check inside, just in case.
His liver is very healthy. It's a very nice color.
I-It was just a dream?
But...
What time is it? Where am I?
I was in the Tiber River in Rome...
And that feeling...
That unimaginable pain I experienced in the autopsy room...
I-It was too real to be a dream...
Hello, sir?
Are you all right?
Why are you hunched over like that? Are you not feeling well?
Jump
Hey, stop that!
What in the world is this?!
Something's wrong!
I-I couldn't possibly die in such a stupid manner!
Don't tell me that this is...
Golden Wind Requiem's—
We have to find him!
I can sense that he's still alive!
I can't relax until we know for sure!
No, there's no reason to look for him.
What?
Everything's already over.
He won't be heading anywhere ever again.
In particular, he'll never arrive at the truth...
He'll never even arrive at the truth behind his death.
Why are you hunched over, mister? Does your tummy hurt?
Eternally.
B-But he's alive...
His end is that there is no end.
That's... Golden Wind Requiem's ability!
H-How many times am I going to die?!
Wh-When am I going to be attacked next, and from where?!
S-Stay back!
Stay away!
S-Stay...
Stay the hell away from me!
So we finally did it?
We're the ones who won?
Hey, come on! Let's hurry back to the Colosseum.
Bucciarati might've gotten his soul back, but his body is hurt.
He's probably wondering what the hell happened to us at the Colosseum!
Right.
Giorno, come on! We're going back to the Colosseum!
Let's heal Bucciarati's wounds and head home!
Yeah...
I'll be right there.
Giorno, that's how it should be.
Don't worry about it.
What we've accomplished up to this point is an absolute victory.
Fate is a sleeping slave.
And we've set that slave free.
That's what our victory is.
Giorno Giovanna
Golden Wind Requiem
Just hear me out!
Taking time to think about what you're eating
is connected to whether or not you're living a happy life.
That's why I think it's really important.
So, there are animals that are carnivores, right?
You know, like lions, cats, and vultures.
You won't find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant.
Why is that?
Because it's too smelly to eat!
It's disgusting!
Listen up, guys! Cats are too disgusting to eat.
Are we on the same page so far?
I'd never eat a cat, even if some culinary expert said it was the best thing ever!
On the other hand, have you heard of a fish called "sweetfish"?
Sweetfish don't eat bugs. They only eat algae.
Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious.
It's because they're not carnivores.
all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals!
Cows, pigs, and chickens!
The better their feed, the better they taste!
Which leads us to this conclusion...
Well? How do you like the opinion I came up with?
I see. That's actually rather convincing.
That whole thing that comes up in novels about human flesh tasting good
I, uh... I actually eat a lot more vegetables and fruits than meat, though...
Then you might actually be pretty tasty!
Narancia, don't egg him on!
Hey, you're late, Bucciarati.
You know Leaky Eye Luca, who's in charge of the airport, right?
His dead body was just discovered.
I've been ordered by the capo Polpo to check it out.
I hate that guy. He deserved to die.
and he sold drugs to kids.
He probably got high and hit his head or something.
Narancia, you may feel that way deep inside, but don't actually say it.
Think about the world we live in.
Do you want me to look into this?
You're going to be a capo someday.
You don't need to trouble yourself with such trivial matters.
No, I'll be looking into this myself.
By the way, Fugo...
Oh, right. You have a guest.
He's been waiting for you all morning.
He's a civilian who runs a flower shop in Monsanto Plaza.
I've looked into him already.
but he lost his only daughter six months ago.
so I apologize for coming here alone.
Do you pay your taxes?
I beg your pardon?
Do you always honestly pay the taxes you owe to this country on time?
Of course I do...
The moment you start talking to me, you'll end up in
She was my only daughter.
She had turned seventeen last September.
If you want to continue this conversation...
And you're asking me to interrupt their meal and tell them to go outside?
I can't do that.
This happened a few months ago...
My wife told me that my daughter had a boyfriend.
I heard that he was a young sculptor who was just getting started.
he never came to introduce himself to us, her parents.
That got to me.
And shortly after...
I'm terribly sorry for losing my composure...
Why do my tears hurt so much?
My daughter was my hope...
My daughter shone with youthful beauty...
I want you to avenge my daughter!
Please make that man pay!
Hang on a second.
Are you saying this was murder?
Are you implying that this boyfriend pushed her off the roof?
If a murder happened in this town, I would have heard about it.
The police refused to look into it further and ruled it a suicide.
Even my lawyer!
But there's something that only her family knows...
My daughter would never commit suicide!
Both my wife and I can say that with confidence!
Please! I want you to settle this once and for all!
Please make him, the bastard who's still living his life as usual, experience
these tears of despair that I'm crying!
Life is full of hardships.
I feel for you, but I can't agree to this.
Are you trying to imply that we're some assassins who would lynch just anyone?
Everyone in this town relies on you.
I'm just asking for the rightful punishment!
The rightful punishment?
Florist, earlier, you asked if we could talk privately.
That was because you knew how dangerous this conversation is, wasn't it?
But what you said about something only her family would know...
To think that no one involved with the law was moved by
I find that rather unbelievable.
I can at least try to make this boyfriend talk.
I'll only ask for that payment once we confirm that he's actually guilty.
Does that work for you?
Mr. Bucciarati!
Mista.
I'd like you to look into this.
Sure.
Bad luck
What the heck...
Bad luck
is this rock?
Kill me
Mista, make sure you put that back.
Uh... Did I knock this rock... off of its stand?
Was it always here?
Be careful when you stand up.
Mista, Bucciarati says we can drive you partway.
Right...
Mista, here's the address to the apartment building.
Here's a picture of the boyfriend.
Find him and make him talk.
You can get a little rough with him if you need to.
Make sure you get a confession.
You've got a tape recorder, right?
Yeah... But how far should I go?
I mean, if he actually ends up being a murderer and killed that girl...
We aren't assassins.
Make it so he can't walk for four or five years, and leave the rest to the police.
I'm sure that'll satisfy the florist's need for revenge.
Menacing
Hey, where are you going?
Mista! Do you want a ride or not? Are you taking a piss?
I'm not! Yes, I want a ride! I'll be right there!
What's been bothering you, Mista?
Well, there's something that's been bugging me about the florist's story.
Did he mention what kind of rock it was?
A rock?
Like, the shape of it...
How big was the rock? The boyfriend is a sculptor, right?
He said it was a strange-looking rock.
Yeah, but what exactly did this strange-looking rock look like?
He only said it looked strange.
Wait, that stone back there...
S-Stop the car for a sec, Fugo! Stop the car!
Why?
Just stop the damn ca—
Why do you want me to stop the car?
E-Er, never mind...
I was just seeing things.
It's nothing.
Are you all right?
Hey! I'm not drunk!
Sorry for saying something stupid!
I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble!
That's his apartment building, right?
You can drop me off here.
Oh, for crying out loud...
Shouldn't someone else go with Mista on this job?
Should I accompany him?
No, I'll go with Mista.
I just remembered the rumor about Stand users gathering in this town for some reason.
You take care of the investigation of Leaky Eye Luca.
Understood.
So the guy's apartment is on the seventh floor...
And above that is the roof.
His name is Scolippi...
The courtyard...
That's a Stand!
This incident involves a Stand user!
And what the hell is this rock?!
Bucciarati!
Episodio 39 The Sleeping Slave
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.
Episodio 39 The Sleeping Slave
Bucciarati? This stone is definitely shaped like...
Hey! Are you the sculptor?!
Who the hell are you?!
Don't you dare try anything!
Who the hell are you?
but why did you follow me from the restaurant?
Daughter?
Listen up, you sick bastard! I'll be the one asking questions here!
You just need to answer!
Just concentrate on that.
Got that? Don't even think about saying or doing anything else!
That also includes lying to me. Got it?
All right... I'll ask you one question at a time.
First off, are you in a gang?
I can find out later if I look into it, of course.
N-No... I'm just a sculptor.
I'm not famous, but I make a living off of it.
Then how did you become a Stand user?
I don't even know what a Stand is.
If you mean this ability...
Was it the same for you?
Hey!
Next question. Why did you follow me from the restaurant?
And how do you know Bucciarati?
Bucciarati...
Bucciarati... Is that his name?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You didn't answer my question, you moron!
I-It's probably not an answer you'll like...
But this rock moves on its own, regardless of how I think or feel.
It's been like that ever since I was a kid.
It's a power that I have no control over.
The rock didn't follow you.
Oh, is that so?
Do you want me to make it so you can never hold a chisel again?
Sorry to break it to you, but Bucciarati's far away from here, you dumbass!
You're the one who's lying.
Let me see him. His life depends on—
Don't mess with me!
What the hell are you doing?!
The rock has left...
What?!
One of the greatest sculptors in history, Michelangelo, once said...
"I don't have any thoughts when I take hold of a marble slab.
and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it."
What the hell are you babbling about, you bastard?!
You're going to die if you don't hurry up and bring that rock back here!
Michelangelo was saying that the ultimate statue is not created from an idea.
It already dwells within the stone as its destiny.
He was an artist who could see that destiny as he sculpted.
and neither did your bullets.
That is the shape of destiny.
The statue had a hole in its chest that was gushing out blood.
but that's going to be how Bucciarati eventually dies.
We're all slaves to fate.
That's the meaning behind my ability, Prophecy Stones.
This is your last chance! Bring the rock back here now!
If you die, so will your Stand! You get that, don't you?!
If he touches my Prophecy Stones, he can die without suffering.
I wanted to see him so I could at least hear his last words...
Wh-What the hell is this guy's problem?
Is he mocking me?
Fine! You want your brain splattered onto that rock so badly?
Look! There are three shots left.
This is how you use destiny!
You're the one who doesn't have time or chances!
I told you. There's nothing more I can do.
Bring it back here right now, God damn it!
The florist had a hard time walking, right?
He'll most likely survive, though.
The girl found out from the rock
She understood that and believed it.
So she accepted the rock, and...
You have some nerve saying that when you're the one who killed her!
Wh-What?!
It's a misfire, Mista!
That bullet was a dud!
That's impossible!
That bullet is Number 5's responsibility!
Aw, why me?
I cannot die yet.
Because the rock hasn't carved my death yet.
Y-You think you're going to get two duds in a row, you jackass?!
You caught a glimpse of destiny just now.
You no longer have any intention of shooting me.
Am I wrong?
Wh-What's with this guy? Damn it!
What the hell is he talking about?
Hello, Fugo?
What?
What are you talking about, Mista? You still haven't met up with him?
Huh?
Bucciarati headed to that apartment building a while ago.
Hello? Mista? What's wrong?
What?!
Bad luck
Prophecy Stones
Scolippi
Wh-What's the number, Fugo? I have to find him!
What's the number to the phone Bucciarati has right now?
Are you all right?
Hello, Mista? Hello?
Hurry, Bullets! Find Bucciarati!
Mista? Hello?
Hey, wake up, you sculptor bastard!
How can I stop that rock?
Hey, wake up, would you?!
Answer me, God damn it!
What do I need to do to stop that rock from getting to Bucciarati?!
P-Please... Tell me.
I'm starting to understand what you told me.
But what the hell am I supposed to do?
I can't let Bucciarati touch that rock, no matter what.
I can't.
Please, tell me.
It'd be better and easier...
No one's been able to do it before, but if you're able to destroy that rock
or change its shape, then...
We found him, Mista!
We found Bucciarati!
We got a report from Number 1 that he found him!
Bucciarati's on the seventh floor!
The stairs! Bucciarati used the stairs!
What?!
Th-This isn't good!
The rock! The rock is on the stairs, too!
The rock is right in front of Bucciarati!
Stop him, Number 1!
Tell him not to touch that rock!
It's no use, Mista!
Bucciarati!
Yee-haw!
Bullets?
We did it!
That was close!
Its shape is falling apart!
That's great and all...
B-But I have a feeling we might've made things worse...
Bullets, what in the world is going on here?
Is that a Stand?
And its shape...
Run, Bucciarati!
Zipper Man!
Don't attack it!
It's bad news if you touch it!
Run down here, Bucciarati!
Mista!
You can't touch that rock!
If you lay even a finger on it, you'll die!
What do you mean?
I'll explain the details later!
Is that rock a Stand?
Hurry and get downstairs!
What? This happened in the elevator earlier, too...
Sh-Shit! These stairs are dangerous!
We need to find another way down.
Going down these stairs is a bad idea!
Go up, Bucciarati!
Wh-Where is it?
It's not here! Damn it!
Mista, what's going on?
Sh-Shit!
Above you, Bucciarati!
Bucciarati!
Wh-What's this face on this rock?
If we can destroy the rock or change its shape...
Mista!
If I just smash it into the pavement from here, it should break into pieces!
Damn it!
You're not getting away!
That's impossible! Mista!
Damn it... What that sculptor bastard said...
turned out to be true...
If you don't appear in the rock, then it's not your time to die yet...
What the hell have you been doing, Mista?
You left the tape recorder on the car seat, you dumbass.
Hey... It's you, Fugo...
What this rock?
Mista, what chain of coincidences led to this?
Uh... You should be fine now.
I, uh... don't even know how to explain all this.
Anyway, about the florist's daughter's death...
but not exactly the suspect...
I hurt him enough to land him in the hospital for a couple of months, though...
I still have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
Was he an enemy or not?
Explain it all in a more orderly fashion!
That's just it, though...
It's really, uh... hard to sort everything out in my head.
Simply put, we destroyed the rock, so everything's over now.
Hey, Bucciarati, I'll look into the incident with Leaky Eye Luca.
No, it'd probably be quicker to look into it myself
It's a job I can do on my own.
Fugo, try to get a decent explanation out of Mista so we can explain
I'm not sure how I should say this...
but do you really think I can understand what he's saying?
You can stop thinking now.
Over...
If you had just accepted Prophecy Stones, everything would've ended peacefully...
We're all slaves to fate.
We cannot change what has already taken shape.
and some of them will lose their lives.
But...
He jumped from up there to destroy the rock for his friend, Bucciarati.
The path filled with hardships that they're about to walk
might have some meaning.
I can't wish for their safety, but I pray that they are sleeping slaves.
Sleeping slaves who will find some meaning once they awaken.
Hey, hurry up!
Hey, Giorno!
Whoa, be careful, Trish.
Thanks. Something suddenly appeared near my feet...
Menacing
Trish?
Hey, Trish! Wh-Where'd you go, Trish?
Hey, Giorno! Where the hell is Trish?!
Unbelievable... Trish is right there, Mista.
Mista, Giorno, I'm right here.
I didn't trip on this rock. It's what was in its shadow.
Don't leave me behind.
Polnareff?!
Mr. Polnareff.
You're still alive.
then your soul... and the turtle...
My body is dead.
I can't leave this key, but I decided to live here for a while as a ghost.
but it's not over yet.
We're going to the Colosseum to heal Bucciarati's wounds.
Bucciarati? But his soul...
Hey, what are you doing?!
Oh, uh, sorry!
I was just thinking that you're right...
I think I might actually smell weird.
So this is what I smell like?
Maybe I'll start using cologne...
Really?
and maybe it's because I was panicked, but it doesn't bother me anymore.
It almost even feels nostalgic.
Really? Really?
Yes. But your fingers are still weird.
What are you going to do with that?
Those who carry on the will of those who have passed must keep moving forward.
I won't destroy this arrow.
Keep the arrow inside the turtle.
That is the duty of those who have survived.
Let's go
The poison rings in JoJo's chest and neck cannot be surgically removed.
JoJo has to defeat Wamuu and take the antidote!
Venice, Italy
What a disaster!
I only said one month as a bluff, but they took it seriously!
I should've said one year!
Hey, JoJo...
Quit screwing around! Start thinking!
I-I am thinking!
But there's no point in thinking too hard about it.
Not only for me. You'll get depressed, too, Caesar.
JoJo, you need to at least learn to do what I am about to do.
The water isn't falling!
JoJo, catch!
Hold it like that.
That's all? Piece of cake.
Here's what went wrong.
The strength of our Hamon is about equal.
But you always release it in a burst from your palm.
That's why the water exploded.
But I was releasing Hamon from the tip of my finger alone.
Just one point.
Using one point creates a vibrating skin that holds the water.
Scattering Hamon like you do wastes energy.
A squirt gun with a smaller hole shoots farther. Got that, chump?
Listen, JoJo. You have to train to control your Hamon completely.
That is why we came to Venice, the home of my coach!
Oh, no!
The two words I hate the most are effort and work!
31 days until the rings dissolve
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 16: Lisa Lisa, Hamon Coach
What's this?
Why would a master of Hamon be here?
Excuse me.
We want to go to Air Suplena Island.
Gondolier, are you listening?!
He's standing on a floating oar!
W-Who the heck is this guy?!
What the...?!
You'll get it now!
I don't know who you are, but you're going to pay for that!
You can use Hamon well enough to stand on water, hmm?
A woman?!
C-Coach!
She is called Lisa Lisa.
But she will be our coach for the next month.
I still have to make you pay for hitting me with that oar.
I won't hold back because you're a girl!
I tested your talents and found them superb.
I'm impressed you can walk on water without training.
However!
You must be prepared to die if you want to master Hamon in a month!
S-She's made a high bar!
What the...?!
Joseph Joestar, you will wear that breathing correction mask at all times.
I can't--
Use rhythm. With proper rhythm, you'll have no trouble.
But if you fail to maintain rhythm, the mask will begin to suffocate you.
You will learn to run 100 kilometers with the mask on!
Take this stupid thing off right--
I-I can't breathe!
Your training has begun.
I'll take it off for meals and tooth brushing.
JoJo, just maintain your rhythm.
It'll be like wearing a Halloween mask.
Y-You're gonna get it, you--
I have one more thing to tell you.
I am not teaching you so that you can save your own skin.
I am forging warriors that can destroy our enemies!
Y-You witch.
You want another round with her?
I don't hit women.
Now, Caesar, JoJo...
...welcome to Venice!
Sheesh.
I respect her skill with Hamon, but I'd never marry a girl like that.
She's kinda cute, though.
Bow to her!
What? Why is a playboy like you so polite to her?
I respect my coach like my own mother.
I won't tolerate rudeness toward her.
Air Suplena Island is 30 minutes northeast of Venice by boat.
Compared to the city, it is dark and mysterious.
But the island's beauty matches Lisa Lisa perfectly.
This is our new training ground!
That entire island is my home.
We have to prepare to face death, eh?
Just how will we train?
I see.
You're safe, and so is my grandson.
I couldn't be happier.
Tell Granny about the poison rings and I'll beat you senseless!
I can't tell her. How could I?
This is the prologue, we call it Hell Climb Pillar!
W-What?!
What's this about?
C-Coach, are we really starting with Hell Climb Pillar?
I haven't ever attempted it.
Hell Climb Pillar has claimed many trainees' lives.
If you cannot overcome this test, you have no right to be here.
Hey, don't keep this a secret between yourselves!
What the hell is this Hell thing anyway?
Step through these doors and you'll see.
Coach, no!
Th-This is...
...oil!
It's flowing down this pillar.
It's 24 meters to the top. Climb using only your hands.
There is no other exit.
If you can't climb, you'll die down there.
We have to get up this slippery, 24-meter tall pillar?!
30 days until the rings dissolve
A test of endurance using Hamon, the grueling Hell Climb Pillar!
This is bad.
I can barely cling to the pillar.
Moving my fingers even a bit is exhausting.
Falling off of this pillar just once would leave me
We'd starve and die!
JoJo and I both!
JoJo, the longer it takes, the harder it will get!
Hurry and climb!
N-No!
I have to worry about myself!
I lost control just by talking.
This is ridiculous!
I just got here!
Damn her! Just tossing us down here like that!
She's lost my respect after all!
I've always been nice to girls.
But I'll come up with some way to torture her later!
Bloody hell!
A lot of trainees died trying to climb this thing, huh?
Are you sure they weren't simply too stupid?
Using anything but Hamon is an insult to the pillar!
Hell Climb Pillar loves only Hamon and rejects all else!
Never forget that!
Wait! Hold on, Lisa Lisa!
I mean, Coach!
Y-You won't really let me die down here
It's my first day here.
This is just a test to fire me up. You'll pull me out later, right?
Such cold eyes!
A look like that means she'll really let me die!
Blast it all!
Who do you think you are?!
You being cute just makes me even angrier about this!
Twenty-eight hours later.
Caesar is at 15 meters.
JoJo is at zero meters.
The rings will dissolve in 28 days.
More than a day has passed and Caesar's only made it that far.
I shouldn't be worrying about others, but he's struggling.
The fingers supporting him look like they're about to come loose!
His Hamon is about to run out!
Fight, Caesar!
He's about to fall again!
He's on his fingertips!
Caesar!
W-Whoa!
W-Wait a minute. Were his fingertips always like that?
He wasn't about to fall off at all! He was...
A squirt gun with a smaller hole shoots farther.
N-No way!
I-I'll give it a shot!
Let's solve a Hamon mystery!
Is this it?
I did it! I'm sticking! My Hamon is sticking!
I thought having your hands flat supported your weight.
It's odd, but the opposite is true!
Hamon concentrated into the fingertips is much stronger!
What a simple puzzle! I've got it!
Now that I understand, I just have to climb.
So how will I torture that awful woman?
Looks like JoJo's got it.
Another 24 hours have passed.
Caesar is at 18 meters. JoJo is at 16 meters.
The rings will dissolve in 27 days!
Now I know why Caesar slowed down so much at 18 meters.
The pillar widens out as it goes up.
This is where it gets hard.
The pillar is as mean as that woman!
Three hours later.
Caesar is at 19 meters. JoJo is at 18 meters.
Oh? What's that?!
I-It's a crack! And it's big enough for my fingers!
Hooray! Time for a break!
What luck!
Yes! Now I can catch my breath!
W-What was that?!
It felt like a switch!
W-What's happening?!
No!
Hell Climb Pillar loves only Hamon and rejects all else!
Watch out! Something's coming!
Crap! I turned something on!
Even climbing this thing might be too much.
H-How can we get past that?!
A sheet of oil shoots out at the 20 meter point of the pillar!
The high-pressure stream cuts like a razor!
W-What's up, Caesar?
S-Sorry, Caesar.
But I know any sane person would've tried to rest there.
Whoever made this was twisted to set a trap like that!
I wasn't looking at you with blame, JoJo.
It was worry.
Can my Hamon get me through that razor-sharp barricade?
There's one way!
W-What the...?!
He's sticking with his feet!
Caesar!
Hamon to attract and repel!
My Hamon is focused at my feet to stick
I have to control two opposing types of Hamon at the same time!
I-I did it!
I hate to say it, but JoJo can't yet control two types of Hamon.
He can't get through!
S-Spectacular!
I'm glad Caesar found a way through.
But I'm not sure I can perform a stunt like that.
Nine hours later.
Caesar reaches the top after 61 hours!
C-Coach!
JoJo can't take any more! Stop the oil, please!
Knowing JoJo, he'll attempt some try-or-die stunt any second now!
But will he make it?!
Hanging around like this is getting me nowhere.
If he tries to break through, that oil will split him right in half!
Even if he's blasted away, he'll just fall and starve to death.
Coach!
To hell with it!
I have to try or die!
Here goes nothing!
Don't, JoJo! Just stay there!
The beat of my Hamon cuts like a knife!
JoJo!
JoJo... He...
He's using Hamon to slide along the oil sheet!
The oil loses momentum as it shoots out.
And so!
He used the speed of the oil to jump on top of it!
He didn't fall! In fact, he's up three meters!
No one has ever climbed the pillar that way before.
Turning his weakness into strength, he's quite clever.
I-I made it!
But it's not over yet. I'm on the wall.
But its overhang is even worse than the pillar's.
I'm completely exhausted.
There isn't even a meter to go, damn it!
I-I can't control...
...my breathing any longer.
C-Caesar!
Don't misunderstand.
I wasn't mad at you earlier.
Coach, please forgive me for saving JoJo like this.
That's fine, but aren't you exhausted, too?
I forgot!
Don't let go, please!
Caesar!
Ten seconds later, after saying Don't let go, 13 times...
...JoJo reached the top!
Hold it, Miss Lisa Lisa.
While I was clinging to the pillar for my life, I was thinking.
How am I gonna get back at her?
Shall I strip you bare, or pinch your nose till you cry?
I thought he was easygoing, but I guess he's the vengeful type.
Which will it be?!
I-I did it! I'm holding water in a cup while it's upside-down!
Marvelous!
In only three days, he's learned how to control Hamon!
JoJo's talent is incredible, but Coach Lisa Lisa's training is even more so!
Coach!
I-I'm impressed. G-Give me more training, please!
You'll see. I can overcome anything!
Forget it. I guess he's easygoing after all.
Believe me, I have many activities ready for you.
I'll impress you into the ground.
Yes, ma'am!
The next three weeks will be harder than this warm-up.
And who are you, sneaking up on me?
Wh-Who are these guys?
The water is like pudding!
These two are my servants and your instructors, Meshina and Loggs.
I-I couldn't even begin to do that.
Do you want to learn?
I asked if you want to learn.
O-Of course I do!
I have to!
Do you?
Then come here and take a good, close look.
Tell us your names already!
From here on, we're gonna...
...forge you into real men!
Breathe! If your breath is strong, your muscles will be, too!
You have to breathe ten times a second!
T-This sucks!
Inhale for ten minutes, then exhale for ten minutes!
If you can, the mask comes off!
Th-This is crazy!
Seven days until the rings dissolve!
Next episode
You must take a final examination.
We need more power.
He's good deep down.
This is unnatural!
I can't take it!
Chapter 17: The Deeper Plan
The spines of this mask can pierce a human brain.
But they haven't the power to pierce our immortal brains.
We need more power.
Oh, what's this?
It's called a Red Stone of Aja, a rare and beautiful gem.
It refracts light billions of times, making it strong and pure.
Its power is miraculous.
But it is not enough!
This tiny stone doesn't give the spines enough strength.
To complete our mask, we need a flawless Red Stone.
We need a super Aja.
Once we have it...
The masks were invented by the most intelligent among them, Kars.
Kars and the others crossed the Atlantic in search of a super Aja.
Suzie Q.
Yes, Madam Lisa Lisa, here it is.
Thank you.
In my hand is a perfectly flawless, natural crystal.
A super Aja!
You had a Red Stone of Aja?!
The Pillar Men wiped out the warriors of Hamon.
But this Stone narrowly escaped them. I am its current guardian.
Caesar, I know how you must feel.
The stone masks killed our grandparents, along with countless others.
And we've met its inventor, Kars.
Smash it!
Smash the Red Stone!
If you break it, they'll cry like babies.
I cannot do that.
Why not?!
There is a legend that they cannot be defeated without the Stone.
Why the heck not?!
I don't know.
But I perform my duty as guardian.
JoJo, Caesar...
You must take a final examination.
A-A final exam?!
Caesar, you must defeat Meshina. JoJo, you must defeat Loggs.
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 17: The Deeper Plan
Are you ready, Caesar?
I'm more than ready!
It's almost dawn.
It's always darkest before dawn.
Now where on earth is Loggs hiding?
I have to stay sharp.
I have a score to settle with him.
Is that Instructor Loggs?
H-How horrid!
I-It's unnatural!
Instructor Loggs!
H-He's dead!
E-Esidisi!
So you came to Venice, to this island.
To think that the woman guarding the Stone is just an island over.
His lungs were pulled out.
Lungs are vital for Hamon-users.
It had to have been one swift kick.
The tyrannical Loggs. You yelled at me for three weeks.
To be honest, I hated you.
I thought I would finally get back at you for all you did.
But watch me from up there, my instructor.
See the fruit of your torture!
Hey, Esidisi, it's six days early, but I'll take it now.
The antidote in your nose ring is mine!
Out of my way. I don't have time to deal with you.
Time? You have way more time than me!
That was sharp. I think you've grown smarter.
But when somebody looks at me like that...
...they're asking to die.
I'll tell you once more. Get out of my way!
Touch me and you'll lose half your body!
Make me!
What's this?
Well? Get me out of your way!
I only move if there's dog poo in my way.
His Hamon is breaking through my skin!
He's learned much control in just three weeks.
However!
I must say your new skill surprises me.
But you're still far from ready to fight against me!
I met and devoured countless Hamon-users like you 2,000 years ago!
If I twist and break your finger off, you'll never use it again!
Like this!
You finally noticed?
Your arm is wrapped up in a fine silk thread.
It's soaked in vegetable oil so it conducts Hamon well!
I was aiming for your neck, but there was no chance!
H-How did you do it?!
I-It's...
It's a little morbid for my tastes.
First blood goes to my instructor and me, Esidisi!
2,500 years ago, a man in China wrote The Art of War.
He said this:
Victory is decided before the battle is fought.
That means laying strategies while your opponent is unaware.
I skipped school a lot.
But Granny Erina made sure I studied history!
You may have lived a long time, but you don't have a head for strategy!
Take this!
W-Why you...?!
Oh? Are you mad?
Are you upset that I disintegrated your arm?
Get upset! I'm far more furious!
Because of that ring you put in me, I haven't slept right for weeks!
I can't take it!
I just can't take it!
W-What's he doing?!
H-He's bawling!
I thought he'd blow his top for sure. This Esidisi is full of surprises.
T-This is embarrassing. He's throwing a tantrum!
My poor arm!
Some things are creepier than anger.
I'll finish him quickly.
Ahh, I feel better now.
My emotions get out of control.
When I'm about to lose it, I calm down by crying for a while.
You referred to Sun Tzu, right?
I know him, too.
Long ago, I journeyed to China.
All war is deception. To fight is to delude.
Anger your enemies to lure them into mistakes.
That's what you're planning, right? I won't fall for it.
But JoJo, I really am shocked at your improvements.
I admire your Hamon.
I've longed for a worthy opponent.
W-What are you doing to his arm?!
It's a bit thin, but it will grow thicker in time.
H-He's too much!
He was crying a minute ago!
Oh, JoJo, I believe I've frightened you!
Admit it, you're scared of me!
I-I can't read him!
I've always read my opponents
But Esidisi's personality is beyond me.
Am I the one being read, here?!
W-What's happening to Loggs's body?!
I-It burns!
H-His body is boiling!
How in the...?!
An animal's temperature rises when it moves or fights disease.
I can bring my blood to 500 degrees and shoot it out.
I sent my boiling blood into him when I took off his arm.
Wamuu can control the wind with his Divine Sandstorm.
But I am a master of fire.
Heat is my domain!
Your power to utterly destroy a body is astounding.
But I can see you're just trying to scare me by doing it!
Try a Clacker Volley!
My Hamon isn't like it was a month ago!
I really did frighten you.
Your emotions caused you to attack recklessly and too soon, JoJo.
My veins will inject boiling blood into your head and turn it into stew!
This is why I am called the Burning King!
JoJo...
Take this, Caesar!
Bubble Launcher!
Stop! That's enough!
If we continue, one or both of us will die.
No, I hate to admit it, but I'd be the loser.
I have trained here ten years longer than you.
But your Hamon burned off all the hair on my right arm.
What can I do after being shamed like this?
You passed your final exam with flying colors.
You're more interested in your
I am only this strong because I didn't want JoJo to outpace me.
And both of us are going to survive our upcoming battle.
I'll say this, JoJo seems lazy and impudent.
But he's good deep down.
T-That's...!
Esidisi!
That was a clever dodge.
T-The mask protected me, but...
H-Hot hot hot hot!
Damn his blood!
and you just burned them, bastard!
JoJo, on the surface you make witty banter.
But in your head, you're planning, aren't you?
You turned pale, JoJo!
Did I hit the mark? Was that a bull's-eye?!
My next plan...
I-I'll use the string!
I'll act like I'm dodging.
But I'll run a string along these spikes while I move.
I can't let him catch on.
T-That laugh means trouble.
C-Could he be reading my plan?
No, that's impossible!
Here's the Burning King's Prison!
How long can you keep avoiding my attacks?
So you noticed at last.
Why is my hat shrinking?
You're caught in my web!
My hat is 100% wool. It conducts Hamon just fine.
Oho?
W-Why are you smiling?
Is there a reason?
Your next line is, I'll wipe that smirk off your face!
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!
B-But that's my trick!
A web? Look around you!
I am the one spinning a web!
I knew about your little plan all along!
JoJo, what did you say?
Victory is decided before the battle is fought, was it?
True, true.
True, true, true!
How very true your words were!
But my plans were the ones to go deeper and decide victory!
My veins have given you some new holes.
Now I'll fill them all with my burning blood.
You'll look like a lovely birthday cake covered in candles!
He's on a knife edge!
H-He won't make it!
Caesar!
Judging from what I can see, I assume Loggs is dead.
If JoJo falls, Esidisi will come after us next.
JoJo's too far away for us to help now.
It hurts, but we have to think about Lisa Lisa and the Stone.
Now, let's prepare to move.
JoJo...
Let me hear your screams as you twitch and writhe in despair!
You laugh as I hold you on the edge of death?
Has the fear driven you mad?
Well...
My arms are folded and my eyes are closed.
This is a victory laugh, Esidisi.
You lost today because you snoozed for 2,000 years.
I lost?! You say I've lost?!
Oh? You don't get it?
You can't read me?
You don't understand you've already lost?
You said your plans went deep, but mine went even deeper!
Humans have been progressing for the past 2,000 years.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, sleight of hand became entertainment.
I'm a huge fan of it.
Illusion is my thing!
B-But I cut those strings!
How are they still whole?!
My rope magic worked!
I laid my trap so that even if the string was cut, it would be safe.
Cutting here leaves the white string whole.
A simple trick.
Now you'll say, My veins will move faster than your pathetic Hamon!
My veins will move faster than your pathetic Hamon!
Feel the beat of my Hamon Overdrive!
I can't... I can't...
You're a human...
I... I-I am the highest life form!
I won't be beaten!
That's it!
You've pushed me too far!
Esidisi's body is leaking some kind of energy!
Is it the energy from millennia of life?
Die already!
Die with the power you stole from thousands of innocents!
My instructor, I must thank you for torturing me.
Grazie, Loggs!
Santviento turned to stone and only feigned death.
But even Esidisi's bones were destroyed. Why is he different?
Maybe it's just because my Hamon became stronger.
He's dead now, and I have one of the antidotes I need.
I guess it reminds me of snot because it's dripping from a nose ring.
But I have to drink it.
All right! I think it worked.
The ring around my windpipe is gone.
So, now I'll go see Caesar and Lisa Lisa.
I think I used my head too much.
Six days until the ring around JoJo's heart dissolves.
Next episode
How about the white one?
Wait until we cross!
But I really do like this design.
I'll eradicate them.
Which to choose?
Damn it! I can't hit her!
I think I used my head too much.
My shoulders are sore.
They feel so heavy.
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 18: Von Stroheim's Revenge
It's dawn.
Caesar and JoJo should be back before too long.
Madam Lisa Lisa...
Which blouse do you like?
Suzie Q, thank you.
White is always nice, but something colorful can be fun.
I'll let you decide.
Let's see, then...
How about the white one?
But I really do like this design.
Did JoJo and Caesar pass their final exams?
Somehow I'm worried.
I have a bad feeling.
Let's go with the refreshing white!
Suzie Q...
Yes?
Send Caesar and JoJo to my room when they arrive.
I'll tell them.
I really like the clean design of this one.
Which is better?
Which to choose?
White!
Then again...
This is nice, too.
Oh, what to do?
The colorful one will do nicely, Suzie Q.
Good choice, madam!
I'll just leave these here.
I'll clean up the broken glass later. Be careful.
Thank you.
Hey.
Suzie Q.
What are you screaming about?!
Be quiet, dummy!
W-Who... Who are you?!
There's a stranger on the island!
You're calling me a stranger?!
It's me! Joseph Joestar!
JoJo?!
No way!
You always had a mask on before.
What a surprise!
You haven't seen my face in all this time?
And so? Am I handsome?
Weird lips.
Even with these weird lips, if we were to fall in love...
...you can kiss them all you like!
In your dreams!
Blech!
What's up?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Oh yeah, Madam Lisa Lisa wants you to go to her room.
But she's in the bath, so wait half an hour.
Got it. I planned to go anyway.
They know about the Stone.
You mean Madam Lisa Lisa's Stone?
Don't worry about it. You don't want to get involved.
Um, JoJo...
Hmm?
You're actually pretty hot.
That's odd.
My shoulders have loosened up.
One ring neutralized at 6 a.m. The other dissolves in six days.
The news I have is important, but Lisa Lisa is taking a bath.
So I'm supposed to wait half an hour.
If I was told to wait, I'll wait.
Where to spend half an hour?
I think the best place is here by Lisa Lisa's door.
Would it be wrong if I peeked through the keyhole?
Nice!
Suzie Q?
What's she doing in there?
When did she go inside?
That was fast.
I thought she was on the docks.
What the...?
The knob is covered in slime.
So, Suzie Q, have JoJo and Caesar returned yet?
Suzie Q?
Suzie Q!
Where did you put the Red Stone?!
Who are you?! Where is the Stone?!
N-No!
S-Something's inside Suzie Q!
You have reduced me to nothing but a brain!
But I challenge you to one last fight!
I put the Stone on the boat that just left.
I am here to stop you from chasing it!
You will not follow that postal boat!
The woman I am inside of is still mostly alive!
You will have to kill her in order to destroy me completely!
Can you do that? Are you capable of that?
Esidisi!
JoJo!
You never give up, do you, Esidisi?
JoJo!
Oh, Caesar!
It's about time.
You...
You survived your bout with Esidisi?
You're a lucky one.
JoJo! What were you doing with our coach?!
Cool it, meathead.
It's not like that. Look at Suzie Q!
Huh?
What's going on?
It's Esidisi.
His brain and blood vessels have taken over her body!
Damn him!
Save me, Caesar!
Please...
Everyone picks on me...
...but you won't, will you, Caesar?
Don't fall for it. She's not the one talking.
Esidisi is using her.
Caesar, the Stone is on a postal boat.
Leave this to us. Go after the Stone.
If the Stone reaches a train in Venice
we have no idea where in the world it might go.
You're not going anywhere!
You have to kill me first, wiener heads!
A male voice!
His blood vessels are controlling her from within!
Come on!
Bring it!
Use your Hamon and kill me!
It would be easy to destroy me in my current state!
But you know that this girl's heart can't take a Hamon shock like that!
Are you willing to take this girl's life?
If you can, then hurry up and do it, fools!
Hey!
I'm not soft, Esidisi!
I only have to end the life of one girl
and I can save the entire world.
I consider it a necessary sacrifice.
A-Are you serious, JoJo?!
Time to go to pieces, Esidisi!
N-No!
JoJo!
I'm really gonna do it!
Damn it! I can't hit her!
This bastard!
I thought he'd pop out of her, but he's unfazed!
Enough of your bluffing.
You could never kill this girl.
The Stone has likely already arrived on the main island.
You're too late.
A-And now...
W-What is he doing to Suzie Q now?
S-Stop this, Esidisi!
and cover you all with blood as hot as lava!
H-His blood is boiling hot!
S-Suzie Q's body is falling apart!
If this keeps up, it's not just Suzie Q, we'll all be in trouble!
V-Very well.
JoJo, use your Hamon on Suzie Q!
C-Come on!
Don't make me do this!
I still have nightmares about chopping von Stroheim's leg off!
A plan!
We need a plan!
I-I'll do it, then.
N-No, Coach! Let me do it.
W-Wait! I thought of something!
Remember Hell Climb Pillar!
We'll try that! It's do or die!
Let's go for it!
You and me! Two types of Hamon!
Two types?
I-I see.
I-It might just work.
Got it?
JoJo! Caesar!
I understand.
JoJo, follow my breathing.
Now!
JoJo creates a burst of positive Hamon!
Caesar focuses negative Hamon on Suzie Q's heart!
At that point, the Hamon is negative positive zero!
You've forced him out.
JoJo!
No. It's all right.
Let the sun take care of it.
That low-down scum.
Hiding away in a girl's body like that.
No, Caesar. You don't understand.
I fought with him, so I know.
He threw away his pride and did all he
For thousands of years he lived his life to its fullest.
I respect his life.
JoJo...
Suzie Q...
While Esidisi controlled you, you must have been semiconscious.
Answer this.
Where is the Stone headed?
Switzerland.
Saint Moritz.
A package.
An envelope with Madam Lisa Lisa's crest.
The address is...
Switzerland?!
Are Kars and Wamuu there?
I just checked.
The Stone has to be on that train!
Saint Moritz Venice
And we have to beat that train to Saint Moritz!
we might have to do some dirty work.
We might break the law.
Some of us may end up dead.
I won't.
I wasn't ready before, but I won't lose now.
I'll eradicate them.
Caesar!
Right. We're out of here!
Hey, Suzie Q! Look over here!
This is goodbye, Suzie Q!
But I'll be back in Venice one day!
Really?!
Yeah!
Heal those ugly wounds before then!
Later!
JoJo, you just make sure you come back here in one piece!
Don't be pushy!
You may be an old lady first, but I'll return!
You stupid jerk!
I'll be back soon.
Saint Moritz, Switzerland
Drive the damned car!
What's with your arms?
Something's wrong with the wheel!
Esidisi hasn't called.
He said he learned the Stone was in Venice.
Has something happened to him?
Hey, JoJo.
JoJo!
JoJo, wake up!
5:00 p.m. 6 days until remaining ring dissolves
Huh?
JoJo, we've caught up!
They're in customs.
It's less than an hour from the border to Saint Moritz.
I'm glad we caught up.
Look sharp, JoJo.
Listen, I'm just saving up my strength, that's all.
Let's hurry up and get that Stone.
Then we need to plan for the fight with Wamuu.
Wait until we cross.
What the hell?
Knock it off!
If you want to go on, just pass us!
German soldiers!
What are they doing on the Swiss-Italian border?
You're looking rather spry.
My, how you've grown, Mr. Joestar.
W-What did you say?
What was that?
G-Get back here!
Who are you?! I don't know any German soldiers!
Look at the train!
So many soldiers...
We found it, Colonel!
That crest! It's the package!
And we know what's inside!
The Red Stone of Aja!
W-Why do the Germans want it?!
We are taking the Stone as a specimen for our research.
For the past three weeks, we have been watching you in Venice.
We started when we lost our team in Rome.
We saw your training. We saw Esidisi.
And we knew you were chasing the Stone.
Our base is a lodge up ahead.
Follow us.
We want to ask you about the Stone and Kars.
Let us work together, eh?
We are not complete strangers, JoJo.
Hey! What are you blabbing about?!
Don't think you know me, bastard!
So the Germans are here.
C-Coach?
We have no choice.
At least Kars doesn't have the Stone.
At that time, the German army was marching across Europe.
March 13, 1938: Annexation of Austria
March 15, 1939: Annexation of Bohemia and Moravia
They wanted to ensure their rule was permanent.
September 28, 1939: Division of Poland with Soviet Union
The power of the mask and Red Stone would solve their problem perfectly.
The Germans needed the ultimate power
Five hours later - 10:00 p.m.
I'll read the heat inside.
The fireplace is lit.
Four lights on the wall, two on the ceiling.
Two on the desk...
No, three.
Four humans standing by the wall.
From the right, their heights are 178 cm, 174 cm, 181 cm, 178 cm.
One human is by the fireplace. He's 183 cm tall.
Five humans, all male.
One, two...
That's four.
And five.
So you're Kars?
You're fast.
and have come for it.
And this brutal, calculated assault...
None of my men made a sound before they died.
I'm sure there were five men in this room.
So, why can't I sense your body heat?
Hey, rifle heads!
Do I have to wait forever for food?
Kars!
It's mechanical!
You're...
...von Stroheim!
N e x t episode
We should attack now!
That building is the address.
That was mean of me.
This is German science!
No machine can stop me!
Chapter 19: A Race Toward the Brink
Hey, rifle heads!
Do I have to wait forever for food?
Kars!
What?
Von Stroheim!
Double shock!
This is spookier than meeting a ghost!
Kars!
And von Stroheim, who I thought was blown to bits in Mexico.
They're both right here!
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 19: A Race Toward the Brink
Kars!
And von Stroheim, too!
His hand is metal!
And his face is wrapped in strange machinery!
The Germans are hiding incredible medical technology.
Is it for military use?
Is that what saved you, von Stroheim?
JoJo, I've come back from hell.
S-Should I be happy?
He's not exactly a bad guy, but he's a German soldier.
And I don't like how he struts around.
Still, I'm a bit happy.
Sit down on that sofa and watch me work.
H-He's glaring at me.
He knows I killed Esidisi!
And he hates me for it!
Even so!
Y-You think I'm gonna let you psyche me out, Kars?!
JoJo...
Once I take the Stone...
...I'm going to end you.
Too bad Wamuu is in Greece.
I can't allow a Hamon-user who could beat Esidisi to live.
Are you speaking as a warrior?
Or do you just want revenge, Kars?!
Over here, Kars!
I will be your final opponent!
No machine can stop me!
You think so?
Arms don't bend like that! Both of his are mechanical?!
Now for the fun!
He's...!
His fingers squeeze at 1950 kg/cm2, almost twice Santviento's strength!
You utter fool!
German science is the world's finest!
My arms were built based on Santviento's abilities!
And so, Kars...
...we've calculated how much we should
I'll pluck you like a chicken, one square centimeter at a time!
Hey, JoJo!
Ouch!
Don't you dare feel sorry for me!
My proud new form...
...is the embodiment of the peak of German engineering!
In other words, I am something more than human!
Take this, Kars!
This machine gun can fire 600 rounds
It'll whittle you down to size in no time at all!
His torso is mechanical, too?!
What is that?!
Downstairs!
The Stone will be mine!
Getting it cost Esidisi his life!
I will not let his sacrifice be in vain!
That light!
The blade in his arm is glowing!
I control light!
Brilliant Bone Blade!
I-Impossible!
That blade is made of hardened bone and skin!
It shouldn't be able to deflect bullets, let alone slice them in half!
Why does his blade glow like that?!
Here he comes! Here he comes! Here he comes!
T-That sound!
Up close, von Stroheim saw and understood the blade's secret!
The edge wasn't a simple wedge!
It was moving at high speed!
Tiny, sharp claws like shark's teeth slid along the outer edge of the blade!
Each claw refracted light, making the blade look as though it were glowing!
We can't win!
Not with my weapons or any modern technology.
We can't beat him!
And what was Santviento?
Nothing but a child!
He was a guard dog! He couldn't compare to us.
Now I'll take the Stone.
K-Kars!
That ice-cold sheen!
An edge that can cut bullets!
I can't block that thing with my bare hands!
Even with concentrated Hamon, it would slice right through me!
To be honest, I want to run away!
He's too dangerous!
But I can't just let him take the Stone!
If he obtained the Stone's power, I'd never be able to beat him!
Damn it all!
I have to get Wamuu's antidote!
Kars wants to kill me!
Was this in my horoscope?!
The Stone is in this pocket.
The Red Stone of Aja!
I have waited for 4 -- No, 5,000 years for this!
And at last it is mine.
It was destined to fall into my hands.
Kars!
Wait there!
I'll kill you soon.
T-That bastard...
H-He really does hate me.
Letting him have the Stone would mean the end!
Kars, you fool...
Don't think you've beaten me yet.
German science is the world's greatest!
Von Stroheim, you idiot! How can you boast at a time like this?!
UV laser, activate!
The Stone!
H-Hey, it's sliding down the slope!
Damn it!
The Stone is sliding toward the cliff!
If it falls off...
W-What the...?
W-What's going on?
Kars!
JoJo, go after the Stone!
You can still grab it!
D-Dang...
He's moving so fast!
He plans to grab the Stone and fall off the cliff!
He won't stop for the edge!
D-Damn it!
That cliff is hundreds of meters high!
Kars could survive the fall.
But it's as high as a skyscraper! It'd be certain death for me!
He's caught up!
JoJo plans to slow down at the edge!
But not Kars!
JoJo can't win!
I won't let this slime have the Stone!
Run hard, JoJo!
JoJo, when I reach down to grab the Stone, I'll be vulnerable.
You'll kick me then, won't you?
You'll attack me with Hamon, even if the Stone falls.
Will that work, JoJo?
JoJo... He's...
Right on the nose!
Here's the kick you ordered!
Ah! He used his legs to pick up the Stone by its chain!
What's with that arrogant grin?
I'm the one who should smile.
I expected as much.
A trick like that is really not good enough.
My kick was aimed at the snow!
And it worked as a brake!
Looks like I'm the one who made the nice catch!
Enjoy your trip!
N-No way!
A blade from the foot?!
JoJo!
JoJo!
He's falling!
T-That blade!
Kars's blade is melding with my body!
S-Son of a...!
It's 175 meters to the bottom!
Five seconds until impact!
Falling with this guy?
No thanks!
Clinging Hamon!
S-So heavy!
Hamon goes through fluids easily, but ice and snow are solid!
However, water is slowly sliding down
That Stone will be mine!
T-That's it exactly.
That tenacity is what scares me most!
I'm best at exploiting negligence.
So a tenacious foe is the worst.
It's the opposite of negligence!
It will be mine!
More icicles!
I have to get this blade out first!
Wait, I can just send Hamon through the blade!
Take this!
Just as I thought.
I knew you'd try using my blade.
In that case...
...into the cliff with you!
And then...
N-No!
H-He's gonna cut me!
Kars is waiting for JoJo to rebound!
JoJo can't dodge!
I'll slice you in half and pick up the Stone at the bottom!
You--!
Y-You won't cut this, right?
You won't chop the Stone in half along with me!
I can use your tenacity as a defensive measure!
Hamon kick!
Eat this, Kars!
He's using the falling icicles as a rope!
But they're falling!
He can't reach!
In that case, I'll lend a hand!
Caesar!
Nice timing, eh, JoJo?
Since when do you two work so well together?!
Using falling icicles as a rope?
Only JoJo would try something that stupid.
It was predictable, that's all.
And at last you're able to think up a stupid trick, Caesar!
W-What?!
Nice! Nice!
Very nice, Caesarino!
If Lisa Lisa is up there, give her a message!
The Stone is safe!
I kept it from him!
That was close!
Pull him on up, Caesar.
Now, my German friend...
...your body is more durable than even theirs are.
If you stop with the snobbery, we can work together.
JoJo, you're a lucky one.
I'll let you hold the Stone for me for another day.
Five days until the remaining ring dissolves.
So this is Switzerland's famous Saint Moritz.
A winter sports hub often called Sun Valley.
Chic, relaxed and sophisticated.
A resort the wealthy visit on holidays.
Even the cats look they're owned by actresses.
Aren't we fussy?
Not even a glance for shrimp.
This little princess doesn't know a thing about the world.
Well, then...
...would this smoked salmon suit your palate?
Now, now!
I've found your preference.
Reach! Reach!
Just a bit more...
Stretch up a bit more...
Gotcha!
Oh? Did I upset you?
Enjoy, you pompous puffball!
No, no.
That was mean of me.
It's just because I'm on edge.
Five days till the ring dissolves.
Kars is serious about killing me.
I can feel the threats closing in.
I have to relax.
I'm the one always saying that you can't mope about stuff.
JoJo, what are you doing?!
Come here and look!
Yes, ma'am!
Be right there!
That building is the address Esidisi put on the package.
Looks like an old, closed-down hotel.
A perfect hideout for Kars during the day.
The windows are boarded up. No sunlight in there.
I'm sure Kars hides there during the day.
I bet he's waiting for Wamuu.
So, what is the plan?
That's easy.
We should attack now!
I agree. Kars can't go out during daylight.
We have the advantage.
JoJo?
I...
I disagree.
I think it's more dangerous with the sun up.
Kars has lived for thousands of years like this.
He won't have left himself defenseless!
Huh?!
Walking into his lair would be suicidal!
I won't go!
It'd be like a bug walking into a web!
Come on.
JoJo, this isn't like you.
Are you scared?
I'll take Sun Tzu's advice here.
Only fight when victory is assured.
I said I won't go!
Are you chickening out?!
Chickening out?
My head is cool. I'm thinking straight.
We have to wait for his move!
You want a sure victory?
Kars is alone. We are four!
We have the numbers!
We have to strike now, before Wamuu arrives!
Caesar, you're going off half-cocked!
Keep your head. Calm down and think.
If we walk in there, he's the one in control!
I'm not half-cocked. I'm gonna end this!
I'll finish the fight that killed both of our grandfathers!
I'll destroy Kars!
You'll finish it?
What about our dead grandfathers? Who cares?
Don't drag the dead into this, you idiot!
What did you say, JoJo?!
Family you've never met doesn't mean crap!
Only a complete moron would die for that!
Caesar?
Watch your mouth, JoJo!
What was that for, you--?
A sucker punch, eh?!
Oh, it's on!
What the hell, Caesar?!
Shut the hell up, JoJo!
Caesar, stop it!
You too, JoJo!
Caesar!
Y-You bastard...
Have you lost it? You're acting like a madman!
JoJo, I thought you'd understand inheriting a battle like this.
I was wrong!
I'm going.
Caesar, JoJo is right. It's too dangerous.
We don't know what might be in there.
We will wait for Kars.
That's an order, Caesar.
Protecting the Stone is our first objective.
Coach, I'm sorry.
I can't obey.
You know this is a blood issue.
It's a Zeppeli problem!
I can't leave it unsettled while I know where Kars is!
I can't sit back and wait for him to come!
Well?
Follow him and stop him from entering, even if it means force.
C-Caesar...why?
Why are you so grim all of a sudden?
Why can't you wait a while?
JoJo, you've touched on a piece of his hidden past.
You didn't mean it, but your words hit him where he's most sensitive.
His hidden past?
W-What could it be?
Next episode
I feel like I did when I was poor!
I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!
Very well. You are worthy of death at my hands!
Chapter 20: Young Caesar
Seven years later, in the year 1888...
-London's East End, 1888-
...Jack the Ripper stalked the streets, terrorizing the women of London.
And a feud between JoJo and Dio would
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 2: A Letter From the Past
He caught it!
The ball is intercepted by the school hero, Jonathan Joestar!
Joestar, the mild-mannered, 195-cm giant
Can he win his last game before graduating?!
He's been tackled!
But he's still standing!
Two more fly in! Three men are on him!
Incredible!
He's dragging them along in his charge toward the goal!
What power! What determination! He's a juggernaut!
And another tackle!
He's wavering at last!
There's the pass!
It's good!
Look who caught it!
That's our Dio Brando!
Can he make it?
He dodges one!
And another!
He's done it!
He's free!
He shows off his lightning speed!
Try!
They did it!
They've won their final game!
JoJo and Dio! What teamwork! What an amazing duo!
We did it!
That was some fine running!
Yeah, but it was all thanks to you.
Dio aims to graduate with top grades in law.
JoJo has written a fine thesis on archaeology.
This victory belongs to them! They're the pride of our school!
JoJo, let's tell Father about this right away!
How long has it been since my dad adopted Dio?
I smile and act friendly, but I can't think of him as a real brother.
Why not? He's both talented and kind.
But I can't forget what happened seven years ago.
Dio, can you tell us about your friendship with JoJo?
That's an embarrassing subject.
C'mon. We want to hear.
Well...
Friendship?!
Don't stand next to me with your idiot grin!
Once I graduate, I'll have no use for Sir Joestar.
I've spent seven years patiently waiting and playing along.
How are you feeling, Father?
Better, except for this cough.
The doctors want me in the hospital.
You should stay away from the hospital.
Hospitals don't cure anyone. They're only after profits.
I won't go. I feel better at home.
My chest pains are better, and the swelling has gone down.
I'm getting better.
It was only a cold. Why has it gotten this bad?
Oh, and congratulations on your victory today.
You already heard?
An old college friend informed me.
Some friend!
I'm very pleased. I'm proud to have such excellent sons.
You've come especially far, Dio.
Follow your dreams after graduation.
I'll support you in every way. You're family.
I am grateful that you have lifted me out of poverty.
I'll keep striving to improve.
Only I know about it.
What purpose could this mask have been created for?
But it belonged to my mother, so it makes me think of her.
I hope one day I can solve its riddle and stir up a sensation!
Oops!
Thank you again, Dio.
I must be getting old.
I just had a terrifying thought!
Dio is...
Dio is...
Dio!
What are you doing with that medicine?
What do you mean?
Have you always brought Dad his medicine?
Yes. Why?
I came across an old letter written by your real father.
It says here, I'm terribly sick.
I know it will be the end of me.
My chest hurts, my fingers are swollen
Those are the same symptoms as Dad's!
What's going on here, Dio?!
What are you trying to say?
I'm having this medicine checked!
If you doubt that medicine, you doubt our friendship.
Our friendship will be lost!
I can't look him in the eye!
It's because I haven't confirmed my doubt yet.
JoJo, put the medicine back on the tray.
We'll just forget this foolishness.
Dio, swear your innocence on the honor of your real father!
If you can do that, I'll do as you say and forget all of this!
If my hunch is correct, his prideful personality won't let him do it.
Swear it to me, Dio!
Swear?
Swear on his honor?!
Don't be absurd!
That bastard never had any honor!
You just proved my doubt.
Your reaction is unnatural.
I don't know what happened between you
I'll defend my father, and my family!
So that's how it is?
I see what you've been planning!
I won't let you near my father!
I'll analyze this medicine and give it to the police!
Damn it! I was so close!
Was him finding out an omen?
No! I won't let a worm like him interfere with my plans!
I have no use for a dead woman!
He pushed Mother to death.
Just thinking his blood flows in my veins drives me crazy!
There's no turning back now!
Dad, I'm going to London for a few days.
While I'm gone, only accept medicine from these doctors.
You can't trust my treatment?
Please do as JoJo says.
I don't know his reasons, but I trust my son.
D-Dad...
He's getting worse.
He may need an antidote.
I have to finish JoJo before he finds out about the medicine.
And it has to be a perfect crime.
This mask reacted to my blood seven years ago.
If those spikes enter JoJo's brain, he'll die instantly.
And it will look like an accident, so no one will suspect.
JoJo, your curiosity will be the death of you!
-London, two days later-
Whoa!
The university couldn't identify the medicine.
Chances are it's Asian medicine.
That means...
Young man, that's Ogre Street, the most dangerous part of London.
I know, but I have no choice but to go.
You can leave if you want.
Dio lived in London.
Asian medicine can only be found here.
I'll find it, my evidence and the antidote.
Another dead end.
That cat was eating a puppy!
Take him, Tattoo!
Use that knife of yours to slice that snob to ribbons!
I see this street has earned its name.
This idiot just grabbed my knife!
All I have to do is yank and you'll lose four fingers!
I can afford to lose a few fingers.
I'm fighting to protect my family!
Tell me where they sell Asian medicine around here!
Hey, you!
You said you'd be fine missing four fingers!
Don't try to bluff me, rich kid!
Let's dance.
I have to find that shop no matter the cost!
Have you ever fought before? You're only covering your head!
That went to the bone!
The knife threw me off, but my hat still got you good!
He's a monster!
That was no bluff! He was prepared to lose both legs, let alone fingers!
His will has overcome his pain and fear.
I never should have picked a fight with a guy as tough as him!
What? JoJo went to Ogre Street alone?
I'm sorry, but yes.
Don't worry Sir Joestar with this.
Yes, sir.
I guess I won't need to use the mask.
Has he already died like a dog?
S-Stop!
I won't allow anyone to lay a finger on that gentleman!
Gentleman?
Tell me something.
Why did you hold back on me?
A leg like yours should have totally ruined my face.
I'm here for my father's sake.
I don't want to cause them grief.
Is this guy for real? He's completely naive!
But...
Yes, my friends are all fine, too.
He's a true gentleman to the core!
I like your style!
Tell me your name.
Jonathan Joestar.
You're looking for Asian medicine?
JoJo's been gone for three days.
He does what he says he will.
He's really grown into a man.
That is why I was so hard on him, maybe too hard.
I'm sure JoJo is dead in an alley by now.
Did he find any evidence?
Why can't I stop drinking?!
Just like that wretched father of mine!
Damn it!
Watch where you're going, numbskull!
Hey friend, check if that brat left a pee stain on my coat!
Are you deaf, you snot-nosed punk?
You won't get away with that!
A disgusting insect like you has a lot
What an excellent opportunity.
I'll try this on you before I use it on JoJo.
What are you blabbering about?!
A live-body experiment!
What is that light?!
Was I hallucinating?
He's dead.
Just a boring little toy for torturers.
Impossible!
He's alive!
What is he?
Those teeth!
What incredible strength!
He's not stopping. Does he feel no pain?
He shattered my shoulder with just a tap!
I have to jump into the river.
So thirsty...
I don't know why, but I feel terribly thirsty.
He's draining my blood.
What the...
So this is the mask's secret.
But...
No! I don't want the sun to be the last thing I see!
The sun...
What's the matter? Why is it dark in here?
JoJo!
I have proof of your devilish plot!
Next episode
JoJo, I have a final favor to ask.
This guy stinks worse than a pile of puke!
- I'm throwing away my humanity, JoJo! - Dio!
TOP	Chapter 3: Time With Dio
Caesar was the son of Mario Zeppeli, the best furniture maker in Naples.
Mario was a proper Italian, dedicated to his family.
To Caesar, he was the ideal man.
When Caesar was ten, Mario left without a word.
They were motherless, and distant relatives stole all they had.
Caesar became delinquent and grew to hate his father.
I bet he's living carefree with some woman!
I'll find and kill him!
He threw away his youth and his future.
He committed theft, arson, assault -- anything short of murder.
Even mafiosos feared him.
Hey, you're Caesar, right? What's your last name?
I don't have one!
Then you aren't Italian. Italians are proud of their families.
Never holding back, he started fights by using a wrench.
With his foe stunned, he finished them off!
Though he didn't know it, he was already using Hamon.
Then, at age 16 in Rome...
No mistake. It's him!
Caesar felt he might murder his own father.
However!
W-What is that?!
That's a diamond, all right.
Boy, don't touch that stone!
You!
W-What's this wall doing?!
S-Stay back. It's a trap!
The events of 50 years ago were unknown to Caesar.
Will, Caesar's grandfather, had died tragically.
He searched the world for a way to defeat the monsters within.
But Caesar was totally unaware of this.
Y-Young man, I ask you a favor.
Speak with a woman in Venice named Lisa Lisa.
She is the only one who can stop them.
Perhaps because Caesar had grown, Mario did not recognize his son.
Fa...
Caesar's father had left to keep his children safe from all this.
Father!
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 20: Young Caesar
I see.
Caesar's misunderstanding led to hatred.
But that became pride in his father and his family.
So Caesar picked up where his father had left off.
He wants to avenge his father.
Forgive me, Caesar.
I didn't mean to speak ill of your family.
then you must have a way to beat Kars.
I've changed my mind!
Caesar Zeppeli!
One set of footprints leads in.
W-Who was that?
I swear I saw someone.
Am I seeing things?
No, that's not an illusion!
What the hell is that!
Caesar?
He vanished!
But I know he's here.
He's within a few steps.
Does Kars have a new trick?
No, the sun is too strong.
He can't be outside!
The cat stance, an element of kung fu.
Caesar has never heard of kung fu.
But he relaxes his limbs, ready for attack from any direction.
For him, it is a reflex.
Caesar!
What are you doing? Going in alone is madness!
Stay back, instructor!
I can't move, let alone go inside.
Something is hiding in the entrance!
What's that?
I can't see a--
A-A single footprint.
He jumped!
He's coming from above!
I-It's...
...Wamuu!
Instructor Meshina!
What the hell? That was Wamuu.
Are he and Kars in there together?
But how can Wamuu come out during the day?!
He does look ghostlike somehow.
Where is that smart-talking upstart?
JoJo...
I hear he's learned much.
Where is the man who killed Master Esidisi?
Wind. Wamuu can control the wind.
That's why he's transparent.
Air is coming from those pipes in his chest.
It's slightly visible because of water vapor.
I've got it!
He's cloaking himself in vapor from those pipes.
It's refracting the light.
It's like a suit that bends light, protecting him from the sun!
That's why he's transparent!
So JoJo isn't here.
You're Caesar, the bubble-user, right?
Just by looking at you, I can see you've also learned much.
Very well. You are worthy of death at my hands!
We'll see who dies!
I feel like I did when I was poor!
Just like when you killed my father!
I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!
Don't think your wind will just blow my bubbles away!
Some bubbles go through wind!
I've updated my grandfather's Hamon Cutter!
Bubble Cutter!
High speed rotation turns the bubbles into disks!
Hamon ensures they won't pop!
The wind protecting you is just air to them!
Instead of defending you...
...it'll suck them in!
His skill with Hamon is more than I bargained for.
Now, Hamon-user!
Hold it! I won't let you go inside!
Gliding Bubble Cutter!
Now, while you're off balance...
...I'll give you a Hamon kick!
But Caesar was in for a shock!
If you are tripped, you try not to fall.
Especially if you need to escape the sunlight.
But Wamuu was different!
He bent backwards!
He's not just an immortal monster!
With senses like that, he's a fighting genius as well!
But my Bubble Cutter must have damaged him severely.
The advantage is mine!
I have a way to beat you indoors!
My nerves are honed to a razor edge.
I can even feel differences in the air.
I have the itch like when I was poor.
My breathing is normal. I'm not sweating.
Perfect Hamon conditions!
Instructor Meshina!
Taken off your coat, have you, Wamuu?
Caesar and Meshina aren't here!
Are they already inside?
T-That's...
What happened?
Take this, Wamuu!
Bubble Launcher!
I said that won't work!
Bubble Cutter!
Running?!
I won't run or hide!
Bubble Cutter!
You're dead, Wamuu!
Gliding Bubble Cutter!
Wamuu!
No more games!
It's over!
Divine Sand--
Stop and look around!
My Bubble Cutters are now Bubble Lenses floating in the air!
Lenses?
And that hole you knocked in the wall
The lenses send sunlight...
...into the hotel!
Huh?!
You can't move!
You're film! A frozen image!
You're totally exposed!
Trying your barrier again?
I won't let you!
I'll finish you off with a direct Hamon blast!
One point...
...at one moment.
A tiny blind spot.
Caesar's body created a shadow at one point!
Wamuu didn't lose his chance!
He showed Caesar once again that he was a fighting genius!
Wind power! Divine Sandstorm!
S-Such destruction!
I-It couldn't be!
It's Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm!
So that means Caesar is...!
You had grown so much.
I am satisfied.
I haven't had such a fight in ages...
...warrior of Hamon.
And it was a close one, too.
If my wind didn't have the strength to blow away your lenses...
...I have no idea how I could've stopped the light.
And if Lord Kars, who cannot use wind, had met you here first...
...and met your power...
Even if he had won...
...he would've been in worse shape than I am now.
Don't.
You will not fight again.
My Divine Sandstorm has shredded your body.
Stop. The battle is done.
You have no more Hamon.
See?
You've almost bled out.
That means you have no hope.
Stop.
Goodbye.
Your life has ended.
What?!
My lip ring with the antidote. Why?
I-I'm...not afraid to die.
But I am a proud member of the Zeppeli family.
It is in my blood.
Something like this might mean nothing
My grandfather gave his Hamon energy
It's tradition. I have to do something.
I can't let my life's flame sputter out.
This is the Zeppeli family spirit, from the past to the future!
It's the human spirit!
JoJo, this is the last of my Hamon!
Take it!
That's Caesar!
Did you hear that?
Yes.
Caesar can't be...!
Caesar!
He made a bubble from his blood.
He must have used all of his Hamon to make it.
He saved it for this, for his friends, rather than using it on me.
I'll let it go.
It's not because I'm sentimental.
His talent as a fighter was real.
He has my respect as a fellow warrior.
I will hold you forever in my memory...Caesar.
A man as splendid and as fleeting as a bubble.
T-The place is a wreck.
A Divine Sandstorm did this.
And Caesar was caught in it.
A bubble...
C-Could it be...?
No!
It's Caesar's bandana!
And...
A ring! Wamuu's lip ring!
This Hamon energy feels strange!
W-Whoa!
I haven't called Caesar's name since we got here.
It was because I was scared.
If I cried out his name and there was no response...
If there was only silence... That's what scared me.
I wouldn't accept it.
So I didn't call him.
But now I know.
The Hamon in that bubble told me everything.
Right here, moments ago...
...Caesar died.
Caesar, you bastard. You were a showoff till the end.
Leaving a gift like this...
Caesar, where are you?!
Where are you sleeping?!
I'll find you! I'll dig you up! Caesar!
JoJo!
This isn't the time to search or grieve.
What?!
There are two of them and two of us. Even numbers.
But all that trail of blood says Caesar hurt Wamuu badly.
We're in enemy territory.
Let's go and finish it.
JoJo, come on.
Take the antidote, then we'll hunt them.
T-That heartless...
Not even a single tear for Caesar?!
Coach Lisa Lisa...
...your cigarette's backwards.
She's our coach, she has to keep a cool exterior.
I know she wants to cry much more than I do.
I have to hold my feelings back.
Caesar, I know you thought I was self-centered.
But sometimes I understand how others feel.
I might be learning.
But I'll fight them like the devil!
Your spirit rests with me!
Blood...
It's blood.
That's where Caesar fell.
Caesar...
Caesar...
Caesar!
They're in enemy territory. Kars and Wamuu are near.
But the two couldn't help themselves.
JoJo called Caesar's name.
Lisa Lisa's tears flowed freely.
But their cries were only answered by cold silence.
Caesar was gone.
The silence confirmed the fears of JoJo and Lisa Lisa.
Though his body had died, his soul lived on.
Rest in peace, Caesar Zeppeli.
Next episode
I'm in a bad mood.
I'll hug you to death!
We fight tonight, under the full moon.
You have no tomorrow.
Fight alongside me, Caesar!
Chapter 21: A Hundred Against Two
This building was originally a 14th-century castle.
It was converted into a hotel in the early 1900s.
But it closed 10 years ago when its owner died.
Now Kars has turned it into a shelter from the sun.
The enemy lurks within.
But JoJo and Lisa Lisa know nothing of the hotel's layout.
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 21: A Hundred Against Two
Damn it!
What's with the creepy cobwebs?
Clean the place!
We're depressed enough without these decorations!
But look at this trail of blood.
Wamuu took a heavy beating from Hamon.
Caesar didn't go down without a fight.
We can't let Wamuu recover!
We're going in, Coach Lisa Lisa!
What is it?
W-Well...
T-This doorknob really grossed me out.
It feels like I'm grabbing some guy's hand.
I'm not a door!
Huh?!
What are you looking for? I said I'm not a door.
A vampire!
Look out, JoJo!
JoJo!
If it weren't for that weapon, I'd have peeled your face clean off!
I'm Wired Beck.
I killed my lover, but escaped from prison.
But then Lord Kars made me part of his gang with a mask.
He has my loyalty.
I'm not going to let you go in and disturb Lord Kars's rest.
Those fiends! So they're already unleashing their hounds upon humans?!
How troublesome.
You're just a pawn that's bound for hell.
Here, let me give you a little push into the abyss!
Lisa Lisa?
Beautiful! Magnificent! Such lovely skin you have!
Hold me! Let me drink your life through that skin!
I'm in a bad mood.
I don't want to hear from or look at a worm like you.
But if you want to hold me, just try.
It'll be the last thing you do.
Spikes!
So that's what they are!
They're spikes, not fingers!
He's covered in wire-like body hair!
I don't like it when women make jokes about me.
Girls who laugh at me get punished!
I'll give you a squeeze!
I'll hug you to death!
Yikes! He's faster than I thought!
Her scarf!
I see. Her scarf becomes a Hamon-filled weapon.
A scarf?
You want to catch me?
Don't make me laugh!
And now I'm free!
Uh... Wha...?
Where are you going?
Come, JoJo. Let's move.
O-Okay.
Lisa Lisa's movements flow like silk.
She doesn't waste any effort!
Hey, don't ignore me!
Hey, you!
A woman like that has to be punished, right?
Oh, no, friend. Your time is up.
You're the one who got punished.
You got a dose of Hamon.
Don't be ridiculous!
She's got what it takes!
I thought she'd be weak in a fight, but she's better than me!
I'm impressed!
She's my coach, after all!
By the way, JoJo...
...you still haven't taken the antidote Caesar stole for you, eh?
This?
Why?
I'll drink it after I beat Wamuu.
This ring isn't a promise between Wamuu and me anymore.
It's now a promise to Caesar to fight and keep living.
Lisa Lisa, will you hold it for me until I need it?
No.
You should keep it.
Who knows what may happen to me?
As they went deeper, the trail of blood grew ever thinner.
JoJo and Lisa Lisa were fully aware what that meant.
Wamuu's wounds were healing.
Are they here?
I've been waiting.
You've grown quite a lot.
Bastard, you killed Caesar!
Calm down, JoJo. Look at the floor.
Don't worry, my head is cool.
I noticed, too. The footprints, right?
There are two sets.
That means Kars is here! Where is he?!
Show yourself!
Yes. Two sets of footprints.
But I feel dozens of lungs breathing.
It's her. I see...
You're quite composed and perceptive for a woman.
I can see how JoJo and Caesar learned so much so quickly.
And you can feel even slight breathing.
You're among the finest Hamon warriors.
Wha-What the...?!
You, you're all vampires, aren't you? Damn it!
No response? That's creepy.
Kars!
Lord Kars gave us, his chosen, eternal life!
It's 100 against two!
When our master gives the order, we'll tear you both to shreds, JoJo!
T-This is bad. It's 100 on two.
Lisa Lisa, we can't win this one!
Wait, Lord Kars.
Back in Rome, we promised to fight each other.
I want revenge for Master Esidisi.
Please allow me to fight.
I shall not.
Our goal is to obtain the Red Stone of Aja.
Don't forget that, Wamuu.
Yes, lord.
That's right. We can't. I'm not in the mood anymore.
I know I could beat you.
But even if I did, all these vampires are still here.
Win or lose, I'd still die, right?
With odds like that, giving up is only natural.
I'm throwing in the towel.
Blast it! You all saw, didn't you?
And I thought I could zap them all at once, too.
Now, kill them!
If you kill us, you'll never have the Stone.
Hold!
What's this, woman?
I'm not stupid enough to be carrying the Stone here.
If one of us isn't in a certain place at a certain time...
...the Stone will be destroyed!
Don't try to fool me, woman.
Do you think you'll be able to find it in time?
The bomb is a small thing, but is enough to damage the Stone.
Is all this true? She never told me.
I'll just run with it!
Yeah, it's all true!
If we die, boom! Kaboom!
Even so, we can't let you leave here alive.
I have a suggestion.
JoJo and Wamuu can fight one-on-one.
And Kars, you and I will fight one-on-one.
And to the winner...goes the Stone!
What?!
The victor will win the Stone and the future.
It will all be clear.
Who will hold the stone, us or you?
Who will survive? The Pillar Men or humankind?
Why you...!
Wamuu?
It's laughable, Lord Kars.
S-She's good!
She's a better gambler than I could even dream of being.
You've got pluck, woman.
Very well. We fight for the Stone.
But don't get cocky!
You have no tomorrow!
She just turned a dire situation into more-or-less even odds.
All right, then. Let's do it!
We need a proper time and place for our battle.
Wamuu, your thoughts?
We fight tonight, under the full moon!
The place will be at the foot of Piz Berlina, 15 km southeast of here.
We meet at the Skeleton's Heel stone circle.
Many warriors found death or glory in that place.
A stone circle?
Hey, you can't just pick a place that suits your fancy!
Wamuu, I think that's a fine choice.
Now, about the Stone...
JoJo!
Bring the Stone to the Skeleton's Heel at midnight tonight.
And be sure to remove the bomb.
The woman stays here as insurance!
Lisa Lisa!
They don't want us to run.
It's a reasonable request. Go and fetch the Stone.
Don't worry about me.
Right. I'll see you at the arena.
Trust me.
I do.
Caesar...
Until yesterday, I lived only thinking of myself.
But a new feeling burns inside me now.
Is this compassion?
Curse it! I just want to wreck those bastards!
And I'll do it for Caesar, Meshina, Lisa Lisa and the rest!
I'll fight for you all!
As I thought, there's no bomb at all.
Lisa Lisa, you're deceptive, even under pressure!
Now, maybe I should bring you a change of panties, hmm?
What're these photos?
It's Granny Erina!
Why would Lisa Lisa have this?
Who are these people?
May 1889?
It's 50 years old!
This young man is Speedwagon!
Granny Erina!
And Straizo is holding a baby!
Lisa Lisa... I know nothing about her life or her past.
Why does she have these photos?
It's the real thing.
We accept your bargain.
We'll fight you one-on-one!
You saw the photos. That means you want to talk, right?
Actually, I had planned to talk to you.
Just who are you?
Fifty years ago...
Erina lost her husband, Jonathan Joestar on a ship on the Atlantic.
He was your grandfather.
That day, your grandmother saved a baby girl's life.
That was me.
The baby in that picture is me.
H-Hang on now.
That was 50 years ago!
If you were a baby 50 years ago...
H-Hey! How old are you, anyway?!
Y-You're 50?!
I-If you're 50, that means...
...y-you're old!
Right? Normally...
Y-You look like you're in your late 20s.
They say Hamon energy is life energy and keeps you young.
But I guess you don't behave like a young woman should at all.
I think I see a wrinkle behind those shades!
Just kidding.
Now, prepare the arena!
Light the fires!
There's no time to talk now.
But we do need to.
My roots are connected to yours.
Our roots?
The mask killed my parents.
Since Erina was pregnant when she rescued me...
...I was raised by Straizo.
A-Are you serious? By Straizo?
Straizo taught me about Hamon.
Straizo gave me the Red Stone.
So S-Straizo is your foster father!
It is tragic that the fear of aging drove him to such madness.
My feelings about you defeating him are complicated.
But I feel it was destiny.
What can I say?
I-It is very complicated.
What a bizarre relationship.
Lisa Lisa carries a past full of sadness.
JoJo, we're out of time.
W-What's the rumbling?
They're here. Now the battle can begin.
T-They're...!
Out of the way! I don't care if you get crushed!
I-Is that a d-dinosaur?!
N-No, it's a horse!
Lord Kars, Lord Wamuu, please move!
They've gone berserk!
Lord Wamuu, please!
What fine steeds.
We used masks to turn these horses into vampires.
V-Vampire horses?!
In this arena, JoJo will face Wamuu in an ancient-style chariot duel!
A chariot duel?!
An ancient Roman death match!
You'll ride through the arena while you fight!
Lord Wamuu or JoJo? Who will fall or be beaten down while riding?
Defeat means death!
Those are the rules, JoJo!
The beasts have 150 horsepower!
Even Lord Wamuu can barely control them.
Now wait a minute!
I'll fight you on any field!
But vampire horses are your minions, right?!
Worry not. The reins conduct Hamon.
Wamuu will use his strength.
You can use Hamon to control them.
I-Is that right? They look vicious!
Don't bite, now!
I see. A little Hamon does it.
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!
Wamuu chose an ancient form for this battle.
That means he's serious.
He's not doing this for fun, or making sport of it.
Beat him, JoJo. We have to win this.
There are no draws!
Wamuu!
I haven't taken this antidote yet!
I promised Caesar I'd drink it after I kill you!
That promise will give me power I've never seen before!
Fight alongside me, Caesar!
I ride to battle!

Wamuu! Wamuu!
Start!
Chapter 22: A True Warrior
The battle for the Red Stone!
JoJo versus Wamuu...
...in a chariot duel!
The match will begin when the moon reappears from behind that cloud!
What a life I have.
Why does Wamuu get all the fans?
One lap is 960 meters.
These horses can make a lap in one minute.
Look at that column.
Each lap, a new weapon will hang from that column.
Weapons?
The one who reaches the column first
will be able to wield that weapon.
For the first lap...
...it's a giant sledgehammer!
That thing could smash through a chariot!
If Wamuu gets his hands on it, my situation will go from bad to worse!
But if I get it first, cover it with oil and fill it with Hamon...
...victory will be mine!
I expect an excellent, fulfilling fight from you, JoJo.
The moon is at the cloud's edge. Soon its light will shine upon us!
JoJo, what are you doing?!
It's almost time!
I know, I know!
The start is the key!
I have to check the rubble under my wheels.
Hey, Wamuu, it looks pretty bad down there.
You gonna clear that up?
JoJo, hurry and climb on!
JoJo!
Start!
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 22: A True Warrior
Start!
What the...?
L-Lord Wamuu is having trouble starting!
His wheels are stuck!
JoJo did it!
That clever devil.
Bastard, you were at work while we looked up at the moon!
You cheater!
Rotten cheater!
I never thought I'd be called a cheater by you!
When your life's on the line, there are no rules!
I don't mess around when it comes to survival!
Beep beep!
He's nearing the column!
JoJo will reach the hammer first.
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Wait till I get my mitts on you!
Gotcha!
I'm going faster than I thought!
No!
JoJo!
Y-Yikes! It got caught on my ring!
B-But now this fight is in the bag!
What luck!
You can have the hammer.
That was my plan from the beginning.
Wamuu has some sort of plan.
Show me your fighting genius!
A little oil and some Hamon!
Bring it on, Wamuu!
Wamuu slowed down.
This is a fight to the death, not a race.
The proper usage of your weapon and your horses is the key.
Okay! Now I'll just move in and whack him with my hammer!
JoJo, you can't slow down now!
You have the hammer, so I'll grab something else.
So, Wamuu, are you ready to get slammed by this thing?!
He was so happy with his hammer, but now look at his face!
H-He sure thinks b-bigger than I do!
No! Speed up and get away, JoJo!
Too late!
Now you have to abandon your chariot!
He fell? I guess the fight ends early.
What will JoJo do next?
JoJo!
I give a 90% chance he'll be crushed by my vampire horses.
There's a 5% chance he'll break left...
...and a 5% chance he'll go right.
Now what will our cunning warrior do?
M-My hammer.
Where's my hammer?!
His hammer? Did he hit his head?
A hammer won't save you now!
He mustn't dodge.
If he does, Wamuu will stop and finish him
But JoJo ran straight at Wamuu's horses!
Yes, JoJo! Quick thinking! That'll work!
He struck the harness between the horses!
The horses ran on, and JoJo used the hammer to send himself skyward!
U-Unbelievable!
The hammer's length kept him from being kicked!
In your face!
And now to give you a good whack!
He's gone! Where'd he go?!
Wamuu is always a step ahead of JoJo.
R-Right! These guys can hide inside others!
That was close!
H-His boot!
It saved him!
If he wore a different kind of shoe...
Luck's on my side!
This hammer got caught on my ring.
Luck is part of being effective!
Now look at yourself!
Your own power has trapped you inside of that horse!
Here we go!
Here's Hamon for you and your horse, Wamuu!
The fool! He doesn't see!
Look out, JoJo! Stay away from Wamuu!
That means...
Nobody has survived a direct hit! Caesar didn't!
You are caught in my Divine Sandstorm!
it was a fight full of twists, eh?
But in the end, Wamuu was the better thinker and the better fighter.
Next up is the battle between you and me.
To be honest, I prefer not to fight women.
Wamuu dislikes it even more.
Even so, all Hamon-users must be exterminated.
Drink that for a painless death.
You seem to be mistaken.
JoJo and Wamuu aren't done fighting.
L-Lord Kars, look over there!
Huh?!
Lord Wamuu's arms look like they're about to fall off!
M-Madness...
How did that happen?
W-Wamuu! What happened to him?!
It's JoJo!
He survived! He's up!
He's just fine!
W-Well, I did it again.
That Divine Sandstorm hit him directly!
H-How...?
Directly?
JoJo was cunning enough to make it look direct.
He's an absolute genius of trickery.
I don't know if I should praise him.
Take a closer look at Wamuu.
I-I see...
He wrapped Hamon-filled reins around Wamuu's arms.
Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm was hobbled.
Wamuu was sticking his hand out of the horse.
I knew he'd stick his other hand out to use his Divine Sandstorm.
And I had the perfect counter!
Look at Lord Wamuu's face!
He's sweaty and pale!
Where is he looking? He looks vacant!
W-What should we do?!
It's lap two!
B-But Lord Wamuu can't grab a weapon like that!
Can Lord Wamuu fight on?
It's no surprise.
Wamuu was struck with Hamon in the middle of his attack.
The confidence he built over millennia has crumbled.
The quiet intensity his victories gave him has vanished.
It was surely a shock for him.
But it matters not! Put out the next set of weapons!
Lord Kars gave the order!
We must obey his command.
For the second lap both warriors get crossbows!
Each comes with two balls for ammo!
The faster warrior chooses the large or small bow!
S-So now there's two weapons, a big one and a small one?
Lisa Lisa, let me say what's on your mind.
Wamuu's mind is in no state to fight.
So why is Kars deploying weapons with such confidence?
It makes you nervous, right?
Here's why.
It's because Wamuu is a true warrior.
Top athletes use a psychological technique called the switch comeback.
When pressured by shock, failure or fear
they can flip a mental switch and bring out their fighting spirit.
In desperate situations, a ritual is needed.
This is Wamuu's!
W-What the...?! What is he doing?!
Lord Wamuu!
Look at his eyes!
He poked them out!
I foolishly relied on my eyes because I could see.
JoJo exploited my weakness.
Now I will use this horn to see wind instead of light!
He flipped his switch by removing his eyes.
Wamuu is now psychologically invincible.
Now he can sense the wind with his horn.
He sees air better than light.
W-What was that all about?
That won't psyche me out!
We lost Caesar!
Your eyes are nothing compared to that!
Which crossbow--
--will you take?
Why ask? You know the answer!
The big one, of course! I need more power!
That one does have power.
Yeah, lots of power.
N-No! I can't draw this thing!
S-So tight! Can I even bend this string?
You got greedy!
You got greedy!
So greed got you back!
I'll use the first ball to get a picture.
Now I see the range. The next shot won't miss.
Damn. How can I shoot back?!
Lord Wamuu, blow him to smithereens!
Let us feed on whatever remains!
J-Just as I thought.
The wind stirred up by the fire makes it hard for him to see.
This is the spot!
He's underestimating Wamuu.
H-Hey, what's Lord Wamuu doing?
He's turned away from the flame!
JoJo is staying opposite Wamuu and near the flame.
He's giving away his position!
He's banking his shot like a billiard ball!
Wha...?!
He hit me from behind!
I was looking at the terrain as we circled.
I wanted to find a wall I could use on you!
C-Can't breathe!
It lost momentum, so it didn't pierce the skin.
But he's spitting up blood, which means organ damage.
Finish him, Wamuu!
But JoJo is a wily one.
Be on your guard!
Has he set a trap?
My crossbow cocked itself when it hit the ground.
I can't let him know that!
I can't kill him from this far.
Closer. Come closer.
N-Now!
He has!
Almost! Almost!
His shot went wild, though.
I should commend him for fighting until the very last.
Here I come, JoJo!
S-Stay away!
D-Don't get any closer!
Go away! Leave me alone!
Please, just spare me!
You cur!
Huh?
He's throwing rocks!
What a pathetic loser!
Go down like a man, little worm!
Wamuu...
...here's what you'll say next.
Do not dishonor our fight, JoJo!
Do not dishonor our fight, JoJo!
Here!
A bat could fly between those stones. But what about you, Wamuu?
A-An iron ball c-came from behind!
B-Bastard!
Looks like I did it again.
Wamuu, I used the shot you fired at me earlier.
The arena went quiet.
Everyone was silent.
There wasn't even a moan.
Wamuu's wound was like a Jack-o'-Lantern's sneering grin.
The iron ball carried a small amount of Hamon.
The wound began to fester.
Wamuu's damaged arms grew worse.
There would be no more Divine Sandstorms.
I-I have to r-resume my Hamon breathing.
A kick after faking a fall?!
You're just lashing out in pain!
Rebuff Overdrive!
JoJo won! Wamuu won't get up again!
W-What has become of the great Wamuu?
I have fallen into such a sorry state.
A body that lived for 12,000 years is reduced to this.
H-His arms!
His arms are gone!
It is not my way to give the enemy an easy victory.
My wounds are my flesh. My losses are my ability.
I will use all of this to claim victory!
His arms!
He fired his severed forearms from the hole in his chest!
What the...?!
C-Can't breathe! I can't use my Hamon breathing!
T-That wind.
It's flowing toward Wamuu.
This is my ultimate mastery of wind.
Ultimate mastery? No!
Stop, Wamuu! You cannot do that!
The wind is going into those pipes!
My ultimate mastery: Atmospheric Rift!
Next episode
You recreants!
No matter what the method...
Kars's stance...
You crossed a line you shouldn't have crossed.
I alone always stand on top!
Chapter 23: The Warrior of Wind

If inherited love is called fate

Chapter 23: The Warrior of Wind
T-That wind... It's flowing toward Wamuu.
My ultimate mastery: Atmospheric Rift!
T-That's wind?!
so I only know your approximate location.
But now that you can't use Hamon, I'll find you eventually...
...and cut you down.
Atmospheric Rift is Wamuu's final weapon.
The pipes he uses to cloak himself suck up huge amounts of air
and then compress it.
The air is then blasted out of a paper-thin slit.
It is a razor made of wind.
But it creates a terrible amount of heat and friction, even for Wamuu.
His body can't handle it, so it's falling apart.
But that tragic figure is truly breathtaking.
Victory is yours! Take his life to salve your wounds!
JoJo!
I-It's close!
I'll have to use one of my tricks!
This one's called the Hamon oil trick!
His lungs are like high-pressure oxygen tanks.
Those pipes...
If I can hit them...
...he'll suck in the flames and explode!
But this is the last ace up my sleeve.
If I mess this up...
I've got you now!
Blast it!
Take this, Wamuu!
A firebomb?
Pathetic.
I can sense things that are away from the flames.
You're out of tricks.
And that cry gave away your position.
Now...
Atmospheric Rift!
Caesar!
Lend me your aid!
More fire?
I can sense things away from the flames.
And now I will cut you in half to claim my victory.
JoJo!
H-He's finally won it.
Wamuu...
You lost the moment I threw Caesar's bandana.
Don't you see I meant for you to break the bottle?
Your ability to cut it so easily led to your defeat.
The oil that was inside is now vapor.
And the bandana you sliced up?
The fire...
...it's still burning.
And I'm sucking it in!
Wamuu...
You were an admirable fighter.
But a powerful ally named Caesar was with me this whole time.
H-He lost.
He lost!
Lord Wamuu!
JoJo, that creature can regenerate, even after exploding like that.
Use your strongest Hamon to finish him completely!
S-So it's finally over, Jo...Jo...
It is.
You paid me back for Caesar.
I did.
Then do it.
Finish me.
I will!
W-What is this?!
That smoke isn't from the explosion.
It's from your wounds.
The Hamon from your limbs spread throughout your body.
I know how painful that must be for your kind.
I cannot mend you.
But my blood can ease your pain before you go.
Do you wish to shame me as I die?
Stop! I don't need your pity!
Pity?
Did you say pity?
So why did you ignore the bubble
Was it pity?
It was because that man was a proud warrior.
I wished to honor him.
No, JoJo, you don't...
No, JoJo, you don't...
I do, Wamuu.
A fight is a fight.
My grief for Caesar is my grief.
Somehow, I wanted to honor you in return.
My blood pays tribute to you.
I have lost, JoJo.
It seems that as a warrior, you stand taller than I did.
Kill the bastard!
Hold!
What betrayal is this?!
What?!
You recreants!
Wamuu!
W-Why?
I am sworn to Lord Kars, but I will
I told Caesar this as well.
It's not because I am sentimental.
To me, only the strong are real.
Victory alone is just and admirable.
I merely lived according to my own code of honor.
To me, immortality was a trivial thing.
All that mattered was living up to my code.
Now...
Drink the antidote for me.
Do it before I fade.
Will you see?
I don't need eyes, a horn, or words.
I will know.
The action is what matters.
I have no regrets.
I am glad I was able to witness your growth.
Perhaps I lived these thousands of years in order to
Fare...well...
Jo...Jo...
Wamuu merged into the wind.
JoJo immediately gave his opponent a last salute.
Though he shed no tears, they had shared a silent song.
They had shared an affinity.
Wamuu, kill him.
B-But Lord Kars...
With respect, he's only a boy.
A boy? That he is.
That's why he must die.
If these Hamon-users grow up, they'll be deadly enemies.
And humans grow quite rapidly.
Can you do it, Wamuu?
Well, since you can't do it yourself...
...let me show you how.
This is how it's done, Wamuu!
Wamuu...
He was too pure a warrior.
That purity made him weak!
Hey, Wamuu just lost!
What a disappointment.
That fool was just posturing.
Your friends are so low, it makes me want to puke.
Lord Kars...
H-He's drinking us.
Now only I remain.
However...
I alone always stand on top!
Look at Lord Kars!
Lord Kars is...!
He's ready to fight!
But Lord Kars, there's no reason to fight one-on-one!
Who needs rules? Let us take them!
We'll turn them into sprays of blood!
I thought you'd do this!
I told you!
T-The Red Stone!
It's me against Kars, one-on-one.
I'll just smash it!
I'm a man of my word.
One-on-one.
My promise still stands.
That's why I revealed my horn to you.
As for my underlings' behavior, they're already dead, as you can see.
Lord Kars?!
All I want is that Red Stone.
However, Wamuu and Esidisi were my comrades for 10,000 years.
I must honor both their deaths and their pride.
I will fight you Hamon-users fairly...
...and finish this with my own hands.
And Lisa Lisa, after seeing you fight, I won't think of you as a woman.
I will fight you with all my strength.
Come!
We fight over there.
The temple at Piz Berlina.
Champions once came here to drink the
They thanked the gods for the joy of life.
It's not an arena, but it will add to our fight.
C-Coach Lisa Lisa, you may be strong, but you're still a woman.
He looks weaker than Wamuu. I'll take him!
You won't.
I haven't lived my life so that a stripling has to stand up for me.
You're 50, all right!
I will use my Brilliant Bone Blade.
I would offend Wamuu if I didn't offer you a weapon.
Take your pick.
My scarf will suffice.
I see.
Then let us fight.
T-There's no violence in Kars's stance.
How can he fight without violence?
What's wrong? Not coming?
Then I'll have to make a move!
Kars disappeared with that light!
W-Where is he?!
Kars... I can feel something...
But it's coming from both above and below.
Brilliant Bone Blade!
A crack in the pillar!
Snake Muffler!
This Satiporoja beetle scarf is a perfect Hamon conductor.
It is a weapon and a life-detector!
It even picks up attacks from behind!
S-She did it!
That's my coach! Wonderful!
He didn't compare to Wamuu, but barkers seldom bite!
Though you are better than me, coach!
Wha--?!
L-Lord Kars!
Kars is behind her.
Who is b-below her?
W-What the...?!
What the hell is going on?!
Kars wasn't the one fighting!
It was a double!
How utterly stupid.
Why would I fight one-on-one?
All I want is the Red Stone.
My goal is to be the ultimate life form.
I am not a warrior like Wamuu, nor am I a romantic.
No matter what the method, in the end...
...victory is all that matters!
T-That's why I felt no violence.
He never intended to fight me himself.
It's over!
Jo...Jo...
The Red Stone is mine!
Now all that's left is for all of you to kill that annoying JoJo!
K-Kars!
You're going down!
Kars!
Out of the way! I'll split your damned skulls!
Zoom Punch!
Your Hamon isn't working.
He's weakened! Now--
Rebuff Overdrive!
You look worn out.
Your breathing is ragged and your Hamon is weak.
And you're all that's left of the Hamon-users Lisa Lisa trained.
Will you last?
Will you last, JoJo?
Will you last?
S-Son of a...
Flay him alive!
C-Crap!
T-That light!
That face!
Listen up, vampires!
You're up against von Stroheim and the German elite!
And we're the Speedwagon Foundation Special Forces!
JoJo!
JoJo!
I-It's Speedwagon!
And Smokey from New York!
My right leg is a bit stiff...
...but my body has been repaired!
Now taste our anti-vampire weaponry!
Ultraviolet lasers!
Crafty little creatures.
Where is JoJo?
He's gone!
He's as quick as ever.
Take your eyes off him and he'll hatch a scheme in no time.
You crossed a line you shouldn't have crossed.
You said you'd fight fairly, but you cheated Lisa Lisa!
And that act betrayed the memory of Wamuu, your fallen comrade!
You can save your indignation, scum.
The end justifies the means.
All that matters is the Red Stone.
avoid risks, and move your pawns carefully.
That is the real battle.
And now I'll maneuver you into my hands and to your death.
Let me tell you something, Kars!
I've never hated anyone as much as you!
You hate me?
Then show me.
One-on-one. We'll fight one-on-one like you wanted.
Lisa Lisa is mostly dead.
But only mostly.
I did that on purpose. I left her alive.
Why would I do that?
She's another pawn.
JoJo, she's a pawn I can use against you.
Bastard!
I've sewn her feet together with this rope.
Why am I doing this?
Here's why!
Lisa Lisa!
Off you go!
She'd be a bad pawn if she fell!
If you let go, she'll splatter on the ground and die!
J-JoJo! Lisa Lisa!
Lisa Lisa?
That Lisa Lisa?
Do you mean the baby on the ship Granny Erina told us about?
T-That means that woman is JoJo's...
Now you're glued to that spot.
Welcome to real battle, JoJo.
I'll just walk up to you and slice you down while you can't move!
Kars, you bastard!
I hope you rot in hell forever!
JoJo doesn't know.
He doesn't know that that woman is his own mother!
Next episode
Are the vampires finished?!
I want to kill you at my leisure.
The fire is a gamble!
This child... This child...
Don't, von Stroheim!
No!
Chapter 24: The Ties that Bind JoJo
Using Caesar's bandana, JoJo barely defeated Wamuu.
Next, Lisa Lisa faced off against Kars.
Von Stroheim and Speedwagon appeared suddenly with help.
However, in a cowardly turn, Kars used a double to fight.
He sprang out and stabbed Lisa Lisa in the back.
JoJo and Lisa Lisa are in the greatest peril of their lives!
Kars, you bastard! I hope you rot in hell forever!
JoJo doesn't know.
He doesn't know that that woman is his own mother!
Don't let go, JoJo.
It's a forest of crystal spikes below. She'd die instantly.
K-Kars!
Your soul is as rotten as a pumpkin
Shout at me. Grumble at me. Insult me.
While you're holding that rope, that's all you can really do.
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Destiny written into your veins

Chapter 24: The Ties that Bind JoJo
JoJo! Lisa Lisa!
JoJo doesn't realize his mother's life is in his hands!
Mr. Speedwagon, we should tell him!
No.
Why not?!
It's not the time.
Von Stroheim, are you done with the vampires?!
We have to help JoJo!
Give me a break!
You think we can get rid of them in just a minute or two?!
Get out of my sight!
It's no good. They need more time!
JoJo...
Careful, the rope will slip if you don't watch it.
While you're holding the rope, your hasty feet can only move so far.
He kicked Kars, but Hamon didn't flow into him!
W-We're in a real fix!
Looks like your Hamon is running dry.
You might have just enough for one last, all-out attack.
I'll just stroll up to you and take
Kars!
It's true I might have barely enough in me for one final attack.
I'm not exactly confident.
But even so, I've come up with a plan.
It's something to make you choke!
Do you want to know what it is?
I won't tell you!
Hey!
You're not tying any ropes together!
This is a match!
What do you think I'll do with it?
Wh-What is JoJo up to?
He set his scarf on fire!
The fire is a gamble!
It's a risk to motivate me!
I seek life within death!
JoJo...
An act like that...
...is just desperation!
Don't toy with me.
You're just dodging around in order to catch your breath.
I'll say it again: I want to kill you at my leisure.
I won't play king of the apes!
Come on, now! I need to breathe!
Who cares if I look silly?
Listen.
I can cut Lisa Lisa's rope whenever I please.
And if you dodge again, I will!
Is that all right?
Should I cut it?
You want me to do it?
You don't, do you?
Don't!
You ran before. Now come to me, slowly.
If you want me to cut the rope, stay where you are.
The coward!
What's your choice?
Is your life more precious than this woman's?
Here's my choice!
You fool!
JoJo!
Lisa Lisa!
Idiot. That's two birds with one cut.
What the...?!
He...!
This rope is connected to JoJo!
When did he do it?!
He didn't have the time!
When he first kicked, he let himself be cut along with the rope!
While he lit the match, he secretly tied
He needed a distraction.
So he set his scarf on fire.
That cunning devil!
Now you're holding me and Lisa Lisa up!
You deceived me, JoJo!
I never thought I'd hear that from you!
It seems you like tricking, but you hate to be tricked!
You may have lived for over 10,000 years.
But to compete with my skills, you need another decade!
Kars!
Your time is up!
Hamon Overdrive!
D-Did it work?
T-That was the last of my Hamon.
I'm burned out.
I don't have any Hamon left.
I-It got into him!
Yes!
He did it! He hit Kars with Hamon!
Off you go!
You...
Look! Kars fell into the crystal spikes!
He's finished! See?
Hamon will travel right up his arm!
You're weak! Your time is up!
Even we could finish you now!
He's trying to spook us.
All right! Let's eliminate him for good!
Bring out the UV amplifier!
Yes, sir!
Coach Lisa Lisa...
Kars said he didn't quite kill you.
I don't think he hit anything vital.
If we act quickly, I'm sure you'll live through this.
It's finally over.
It is. I'm glad.
Hey, Mr. Speedwagon?
Can I ask you something?
What is it?
Why did Granny Erina tell JoJo his mother died when he was little?
Why does Lisa Lisa hide her past from him?
Smokey, that's...
Granny Erina told me not to ask you, but I have to know!
She's his mother. Keeping that from him is awful.
Smokey...
JoJo and Granny Erina are my friends.
They saved me from crooked cops, even though I was just a thief.
That's why I'm here! I'll do all I can to help.
All right, Smokey.
I'll tell you.
You did take good care of Erina while I was away from New York.
But promise not to tell JoJo!
This is a Joestar family issue.
The name Lisa Lisa is an alias.
Her real name is Elizabeth.
She was raised by a Hamon-user named Straizo.
She and Erina's son, George, fell in love and got married.
George and Elizabeth had a son. You know him as JoJo.
JoJo's father George was a member of the Royal Flying Corps.
Aviation developed rapidly during the First World War.
George was among the first brave pilots to fly into battle.
He stood out as a hero even among the Royal Flying Corps.
However...
...a gut-wrenching horror from the past
Fifty years before, Dio had created blood-sucking zombies.
Straizo, myself and the others thought we had exterminated them.
But one had escaped, hid within society, and lived for decades undiscovered!
He was a cunning, intelligent creature.
He created no spawn.
He ate even the bones and hair of his victims, leaving no evidence.
And by some wicked twist of fate...
...he worked as a commander in the Royal Flying Corps!
T-The Royal Flying Corps?
The same.
George uncovered his secret.
He had listened well to Straizo and me.
But ultimately, George was an ordinary man.
He had character and talent, but he hadn't trained with Hamon.
His message to Straizo wasn't in time.
George's death was covered up as a nighttime plane crash.
Straizo and I found this suspicious, and eventually found the truth.
That night, I told Elizabeth as she held an infant JoJo.
Instead of showing grief...
...she flew out of the house!
She was a genius with Hamon, but her emotions consumed her!
She was witnessed when she killed the commander.
The military didn't know about zombies or Hamon.
killed him, and burned his body.
Soon she was known around the world
We used all the Speedwagon Foundation's resources to cover her trail.
Elizabeth had to leave England behind
without even a word to her son.
Erina knew what had happened, and she had a request.
When this child grows up and asks about his parents...
...please tell him they both died.
This child...
This child...
And so Elizabeth became Lisa Lisa.
Why?
Why is it that way?
At least say his mother is alive!
I know painfully well why.
Erina lost her husband and son in
But thinking of her grandson, of JoJo...
...she didn't want Hamon in his life!
Lisa Lisa is the same way!
Such a tragic family.
Such a miserable fortune.
But now...
Now JoJo...
JoJo used Hamon to save his mother's life!
Mr. Speedwagon...
Now there's no reason for Lisa Lisa to hide.
JoJo knows about Hamon, and he used it to save his mother!
True.
But it's not up to me.
We have to know how Erina and Lisa Lisa feel first.
But...
Colonel!
We're ready to fire!
Right! Aim it right at him!
We will have the honor of executing Kars!
Prepare to die, Kars!
I can't tell you how good it feels to order this myself!
Don't, von Stroheim! The mask!
The Stone is in his mask! UV light will help him!
D-Damn it!
Stop! Don't fire the UV amplifier!
N-No!
I-I didn't see him holding the mask.
I didn't see him put the Red Stone in!
Dear God...
Kars...
Next episode
The ultimate life form...
He can manipulate life at will!
Is there no way to stop him?
Kars, the Ultimate Thing, is born!
Chapter 25: The Birth of a Superbeing
N-No!
I-I didn't see him holding the mask.
I didn't see him put the Red Stone in!
Dear God...
Kars...
From the silent depths
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep
Crimson blood
Summons the valorous to stand up
If inherited love is called fate
Then take another step with smiling eyes
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink
Avoid the blade, find an opening and strike
Conviction tested opens the way to the future
Like a bloody storm Hot like a bloody stone
Destiny written into your veins
The undying bonds of honor arise
Take hold of them
Chapter 25: The Birth of a Superbeing
He stood up!
Stand your ground! German soldiers are not cowards!
The ultimate being?
Madness! No creature could ever become perfect!
Kars...
Look at his arm! It's still smoking!
The Hamon will ruin him!
He'll melt where he stands!
but he is still utterly the same!
And he'll die like that!
Fire the UV amplifier again!
We'll end him for sure this time.
Hurry it up!
Sir!
What's going on with him?
What is he staring at?
L-Look!
See? Over there!
Wh-What the hell is that?!
Am I seeing things? His hand turned into a squirrel!
It's kind of cute, actually.
Look out!
It's dangerous! Stay away from that squirrel!
The squirrel!
Get out of here! Hurry!
Unbelievable! He can manipulate life at will!
Hooray!
The sun is rising!
The vampires...
The sunlight will take care of Kars. We're saved!
It's no good. He's fine!
He's still standing, even under the sun!
This is a nightmare! It can't be!
This looks like our doom!
A perfect life form combines the abilities of all other life forms.
It combines all life into one.
But this...
Breathtaking. Such beautiful radiance.
That light is the most wonderful thing I've seen.
And now I have conquered it.
H-He's invincible!
He has no weaknesses! Even Hamon won't work on him!
He's immortal! Unstoppable! No one can beat him!
He is complete! Kars, the Ultimate Thing, is born!
T-This is my fault.
I let him put on the mask with the Red Stone in it.
Is... Is there no way to stop him?
Are we humans destined to die, to become food for him?
No, I have a plan.
What was that, JoJo?
Hold her.
Yeah...
I have one last plan.
A final plan?
Yeah, I save it for last.
What is it?
JoJo, d-do you mean that final plan?
Listen up! Do it till your last breath!
Do what until my last breath?
Run away!
I knew it!
Hamon-users mean nothing to me now.
But you...
Wamuu and Esidisi need to be avenged, and I must celebrate.
JoJo, your death...
...will be dedicated to my birth!
He's catching up!
Pipe down!
I'm trying to think up with something! Keep quiet!
JoJo's going out there to save Lisa Lisa and the rest of us!
But it's useless! No plan of his could overcome what Kars has become!
He's coming! Hurry!
Hey, Smokey!
I don't think you understand, so I'll tell you something!
There's no reason for you to be running with me!
Kars is after my blood alone!
He thinks killing me is the best way to ring in his new life!
JoJo, there's something you have to hear!
Lisa Lisa, your coach, she's your...
He's here! He's here!
Speedwagon, is he...?
Is he really the perfect being?
Yes, the power of the Red Stone will
A perfect being is: One, invincible.
Two, does not age.
Three, will not ever die.
Four, has the abilities of all other life forms, and outperforms them.
In addition, it is like a Greek statue, a model for beauty.
T-There's no way to stop him now.
He has no weakness at all!
Humans can't kill him, not with Hamon or even the sun!
JoJo!
Smokey, your path ends here!
Tell me about it later!
JoJo!
That won't save you.
Let's see who's stronger, Kars!
That's...!
One of our warplanes!
JoJo!
The feathers are as hard as armadillo shell.
They are coated in an oil that deflects bullets.
Naturally, their hardness makes them weapons as well as shields.
His feathers are like knives!
This looks bad!
But...
I got on this plane to get away from you!
JoJo!
All he can do now is run!
Fly, JoJo! Fly!
That's all we humans can do now.
Current speed: 240 km/h.
No matter how evolved he might be, he's still just an animal.
I'm safe for now.
I guess he can't keep up with a plane for long.
The fuel!
Two hours left.
So I can run away for two hours.
Does that fool think he can run from me for even a moment?
You'll never land safely now.
You won't stand on the earth again.
JoJo! JoJo!
Do you read me? Respond, JoJo!
Hey, Speedwagon!
JoJo! Grabbing that plane was a smart move!
The Germans and I will do what we can to help you get away!
Do you have a chart?
It's right here.
Good. Maintain radio contact.
I'll give you the plan.
What?!
First, give us your current position.
JoJo, do you read me?
What's wrong? Hey!
JoJo, respond! JoJo!
Yeah, I read you.
But Speedwagon, no technique or weapon will work on Kars.
You said he was immortal.
Yeah, I did. Your plan to run is all we can do.
Listen up, old man. I have a different idea.
What idea?
Now JoJo, don't do anything rash!
Just keep away from him!
We won't be able to stop him later!
No! Don't even think of doing something on your own!
Just listen to me, okay?
He's the ultimate being on earth!
But he's from Earth. This planet gave him life.
And it might take him back!
What do you mean?
How would the Earth take him back?
Magma!
Magma, the hottest thing on earth!
I'll drive him into the lava at Isola di Volgano to kill him!
D-Don't! You've risked your life more than enough times!
Let us and the Germans handle it!
Listen to him, JoJo! Don't be crazy!
Sorry, I can already see the volcano.
The time is now!
Mr. Speedwagon...
It's happening again...
Jonathan's father, Jonathan and George...
The men of the Joestar family all led short lives.
I don't want to lose you, too!
Please stop, JoJo!
For Lisa Lisa's sake, too!
Lisa Lisa is your mother!
What was that? Say again!
What is that noise?
This is insane!
Piranhas?! What the hell?!
They're chewing up the plane!
How did they get in?!
Kars's feathers!
They transformed!
Damn it! My parachute!
You little bastards!
Wh-What now?!
JoJo!
What's going on? Respond!
JoJo!
JoJo! JoJo!
You're brainless.
That parachute is like a spider's web trapping you, JoJo.
You're just a little butterfly.
I'll take my time killing you!
What?!
I-It's a dummy!
Kars, I'm not going down without a fight!
You're going with me into that volcano!
JoJo!
Damn you!
Lunatic!
Granny Erina, you told me about my grandfather once.
You said he sank into the Atlantic with his lifelong foe to save you.
I hate to sadden you again.
But I guess this is the Joestar blood in me.
Did you really think I couldn't get away before you hit the ground?
Kars!
You're dying alone, JoJo!
W-What the...?!
Kars, this plane will be your coffin.
You!
Von Stroheim!
How and when did you get in there?!
I wasn't sure you could handle it alone!
It was cold in this pontoon.
But you came.
But it's time to jump, JoJo!
What do you mean jump?
But I don't even have a parachute!
Listen to me and jump out of the plane!
JoJo, respond!
Say something! Anything!
Just talk to me, JoJo!
JoJo...
Von Stroheim...you crazy bastard.
You're even crazier than me!
B-But I have to thank you.
Y-You look all right, but what about Kars?
Did Kars take a lava dive?!
You...worms...
Next episode
Did you say Hamon Overdrive?
Bless our mother earth!
Don't you wish to purge your fears?!
JoJo!
Farewell, everyone.
Chapter 26: The Ascendant One
Long ago, an already extraordinary man wished for further power.
breathe like the trees, and move like the water.
But he could not face the sun.
So he created a stone mask.
One day he would befriend the sun.
And the world would be his!
Chapter 26: The Ascendant One
Kars...
Did Kars take a lava dive?!
You...worms...
We got him!
I-I need armor.
Like a clam or a crab...
...I'll make armor.
I'll cover myself.
It's not enough!
It's melted rock, idiot!
It's over a thousand degrees!
You're gonna burn to a crisp!
Yeowch!
T-That did it!
Finally!
We finally took down Kars!
JoJo, that shock triggered an eruption!
Let's get to safety before celebrating!
Good idea. Hang on tight!
What a wonderful sound.
It's music to my ears.
I've been longing to hear that song from you, JoJo!
Kars...but how?!
A bit of his shell.
I see. Kars...
First, Kars covered himself in a shell like a crab.
But it was still organic.
It couldn't withstand the lava's heat and burned away instantly.
Kars's secret was in a second layer of armor!
That second layer...
...was bubbles!
The bubbles created a layer of air between Kars's body and the lava.
Heat from lava Air Kars's body
As the outer layer burned, more bubbles came up to replace it.
Kars could survive in lava for a few minutes.
The Earth gave birth to life.
But now! Alas! In the end...
...Kars had conquered the Earth!
Long, long ago, far earlier than man's first recorded history
a certain group of creatures evolved on our planet.
So they lived below ground.
Even without the sun, they led long lives feeding on other living things.
Early humans that appeared feared them as gods or demons.
Few died, so they did not have many children and their population was small.
They knew no strife and lived in peace.
But then...
...a genius was born among them.
There is strength hidden in this body, abilities undreamed of.
I will unlock greater power!
The genius created a stone mask.
The mask granted him undying power, but he required more life energy.
He had to consume more creatures to live.
If left unchecked, he would eventually consume all life.
His brethren began to fear the mask
His existence is a threat!
He has to be removed from this world!
We have to destroy him!
Fool! Don't you wish to conquer the sun?
Don't you wish to rule over all?
Don't you wish to purge your fears?!
Then fall.
He and one companion took the two surviving babies and left.
They set off on a journey in search of ultimate power.
And ten thousand years later, that power was in his hands!
He's a god. He's become a god.
Humans can't stand before a god!
Submission is our only chance!
What was that? Did you just say something, JoJo?
Die! Overdrive!
Ha...mon?
Did you say Hamon Overdrive?
JoJo!
That shock!
I'm melting! No!
My leg is melting!
What? It's like he used...!
It can't be!
It is! That was Hamon, you dimwit!
I conquered the sun, and you still thought Hamon was beyond me?!
W-What?!
And it looks like my
Hundreds of times more potent?!
It's like being burned by the sun!
His flesh is liquefying and then vaporizing!
So how do you like that taste of your own medicine?
An excellent response.
Well, let me ease your suffering.
JoJo!
This is it. I'm going to die.
It's over for me.
JoJo accepted this fact completely.
He felt no fear, no pain, no regret.
He thought, I did all I could.
Before the epitome of evil, he watched
Von Stroheim was no different.
Unable to move, he felt he knew how it
This way of breathing...
To send a Hamon-user like you into the black pit of death...
...Hamon really is a poetic vehicle!
Hamon...
...far greater than mine...
Sail into the infinite abyss of oblivion!
Hamon?!
What?!
The Red Stone!
What?!
The Red Stone!
The Red Stone of Aja!
Why did JoJo hold the Red Stone toward Kars?
Even he didn't know!
It was instinctive.
But JoJo's body understood.
His body moved in order to survive.
JoJo's will to live pushed his body into action!
T-The Red Stone is a Hamon amplifier.
That energy made the volcano's eruption reach a sudden peak!
T-The whole slab they were on was blasted into the sky!
S-Such tremendous force!
But do you think a little eruption will be enough to get rid of me, JoJo?!
I'll become a bird to escape!
Goodbye forever, JoJo!
Bless our Mother Earth! It shot my arm all the way up here!
Now, Kars!
Your line is, Did you plan this, too, JoJo?!
Did you plan this, too...
For an instant, Kars was distracted by JoJo's arm! One fatal instant!
Hot chunks of rock he could have dodged launched him higher!
Did you plan this, too, JoJo?!
What do you think?! I planned every little detail!
I stacked the whole deck!
That's a total lie, but it'll drive Kars crazy!
The material released in the eruption reached escape velocity!
Even the Earth's power couldn't kill Kars!
But instead...
...it blasted him out of the atmosphere!
Stars?! N-No!
It's over.
Granny...
Von Stroheim...
Speedwagon...
Smokey...
And Lisa Lisa...
Farewell, everyone.
Jo...
JoJo!
Eight hours later, von Stroheim returned alive to tell Speedwagon this:
On February 28, 1939, Joseph Joestar passed away on Isola di Volgano.
I'm in outer space?!
I'll use jets of air to change my trajectory and return to Earth!
I-It's not working!
I-I'm freezing!
The air is freezing around me!
It turns to ice the moment it comes out of me!
I-I can't change direction!
I can't go back!
Kars never returned to the Earth.
He became half-mineral, half-animal and floated forever through space.
And though he wished for death, he was unable to die.
So eventually, he stopped thinking.
Outside New York City April 1939
hallowed be thy name.
on earth, as it is in heaven.
Goodbye, JoJo.
Now that I think of it, we only met six months ago.
But I'll always remember you.
Always.
Come, Erina, you mustn't catch cold.
Let's go home.
Just a bit longer.
Guess who?
Hey, everybody!
I finally got to New York and nobody was there to meet me!
So I heard you were all at a funeral. I looked high and low!
Hey, Coach Lisa Lisa! Are you all healed up?
Meshina, you're here too!
I want to ask von Stroheim if he can
But it looks like war with the Germans.
Hey, now! What are you thinking?!
This is a funeral, you idiot!
Who's an idiot?!
Hey, did you just call me an idiot?!
Just calm down. Let's go have a talk.
It's...
No way!
Hey! Don't start any trouble!
You aren't getting away with calling me an idiot!
JoJo!
JoJo's alive!
Alive?
H-Hang on, now! What's with all the surprise?
It's like you saw a ghost!
Bwah! Why's my name on a headstone?!
D-Don't tell me this is...
JoJo!
You're still recovering, so you shouldn't stand in the rain!
Take this.
I-It's Suzie Q.
What's that ring on her finger?
Y-You don't know about my wife, either?!
Your wife?!
Your wife? Oh, my!
Being introduced as your wife...
It makes me blush!
Right?
Don't right me!
Back when the volcano erupted...
...the rock I was on shielded me and fell into the sea.
A fishing boat picked me up.
Then you nursed me back to health in Venice for two weeks.
But they haven't heard.
You sent a telegram, right?!
T-Telegram?
Yeah, you said you would!
Let's not get all clicky now.
I'm sorry! I forgot!
Oh, no! Unbelievable! What is that woman thinking?!
Get back here!
JoJo is alive!
I said I'm sorry!
Sorry doesn't cut it!
JoJo...
Later, Lisa Lisa, Elizabeth Joestar, told JoJo she was his mother.
They moved to America.
In 1948, she married a Hollywood screenwriter.
Erina Joestar continued her work as a teacher.
Robert E. O. Speedwagon continued with his various enterprises
and helped to further science and medicine.
In 1952, he died of a heart attack at age 89.
He remained single.
Smokey Brown worked his way through college, majoring in political science
and became the first black mayor in Georgia, his home state.
Rudol von Stroheim never saw JoJo again.
In 1943, he died as a proud German soldier, fighting in Stalingrad.
We are the world's greatest!
Time flowed onward...
JFK International Airport, New York 1987
...to a new generation.
And JoJo...
Oh, I bumped you. Are you okay?
Oh, dear. You should watch where you're going.
You're right. I'm fine.
We all make mistakes.
Wait a minute. Are you Japanese?
Yeah, why?
Then I take that back!
Alitalia flight 285 for Tokyo is now boarding.
My only daughter has been married
Why did she get married on the other side of the world?
My own grandson doesn't know my face!
I'll never forgive the Japanese!
But...
...I do like my Walkman.

Part 2: Battle Tendency -- Fin
Atlantic Ocean, near the Canary Islands 1983
Y-Yahoo! We finally got it!
R-Relax! Just bring it up!
It's a hundred-year-old treasure chest!
L-Let's pop it open!
— 1983: The Canary Islands, Off the Northwest African Coast —
W-We did it!
All right! Careful now!
Keep calm! Just bring it this way...
I know! I know!
Up we go.
Isn't it a bit long and narrow to be a treasure chest?
Hey! You're lifting it too high!
Okay, I'm putting it down.
One, two, three!
All right! H-Hurry up and pry it open.
Wait. Th-This is bizarre.
This box is locked from the inside.
Who the hell cares? Bust it open!
Just hang on! There's something written on it.
D-I-O... DIO.
Is it a name?
What the hell does it matter?!
The sun's going to set soon.
Once it gets dark, we won't be able to see anything!
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'll go get the blowtorch.
Let's say hello to our treasure!
One day, an unmanned cabin cruiser was spotted.
The boat was in perfect working order, and there were no signs of an attack.
and...
On deck, a steel box, which had been opened with an acetylene torch.
and strangely, it had two compartments, as if designed to shelter something.
Jotaro Kujo, 17 years old. Height: 195 centimeters.
His father is Japanese, and a jazz musician.
1987: Japan
His mother is an American of British descent.
Yes, Jotaro is definitely my son.
Apparently, his friends at school call him "Jojo,"
That's pretty dumb!
S-So...
How many people did Jotaro kill?!
No! Don't tell me! I don't want to hear! No!
Uh, who said he killed anybody?
He got into a fight.
Actually, the thugs he faced were armed with nunchucks and knives.
and between them, fifteen bones were broken.
They all had their balls crushed, too...
Ah, pardon my language... And they were sent to the hospital.
Ma'am, please make sure he learns his lesson!
Okay!
But the problem is what happened after.
Could you copy this and pass it around?
Yes, sir.
Your son is quite the oddball.
Come in. We'll show you the way.
Thank you.
Well, anyway, please take him home.
What? He's being released already?
Well, we can't keep him forever.
By the way, ma'am, your Japanese is very good.
How long have you lived in Japan?
Twenty years.
Ah, no wonder.
Good work, gentlemen.
We've had our hands full lately.
There's even a waiting list for cells.
Your son is just up ahead.
Jotaro!
Jotaro, throw the ball to Mama!
Very good!
Do your best at the sports meet tomorrow.
Yeah!
Jotaro...
Entrance Ceremony
We should celebrate. What would you like to eat today?
I just want to eat your cooking, Mom.
Jotaro... Jotaro...
Jotaro... Jotaro...
Jotaro!
Shut the hell up!
Bam!
Okay!
Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders
He's actually a very sweet child.
Episode 1: The Man Possessed by an Evil Spirit
He's not capable of doing something so appalling.
Hey! Don't fall asleep, Kujo!
You're being released. Get out!
What part of "go home" don't you understand?!
Mom, go home.
I'm not going to leave here for a while.
I've been possessed by an evil spirit.
I don't know what he'll make me do.
Even during the fight, it took all I had to stop it.
So don't let me out of this cell.
For crying out loud... See what I'm talking about, ma'am?
We're trying to release him, but he refuses to leave.
Forgive my asking, but is your son all right upstairs?
This isn't a hotel!
Please! Let us change cells!
He's telling the truth!
There really is an evil spirit possessing him!
It's terrifying!
We won't do anything bad again!
That's enough! Quiet down!
Wh-What is that?
You've been locked up! How'd you get that in here?!
I told you.
It's the evil spirit.
The evil spirit brings things to me.
Nokotta! Nokotta! Nokotta!
He tosses him out of the ring! Chiyonofuji wins all fourteen matches!
H-He's listening to a boombox and reading !
H-How?! Th-This is a problem!
Hold it!
This might not be enough to stop you from releasing me.
I'll show you what a terror my evil spirit can be.
Just so you'll understand how dangerous it could be to let me out.
M-My gun! How?!
W-We've got trouble!
Well? Did you guys see my evil spirit just now?!
If you didn't, then...
J-Jotaro!
There's someone behind me.
His grandpa, Joseph, had strange powers...
B-But what's happening to my son?
Jotaro Kujo
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Papa!
Over here, Papa! Over here!
Holly! Hey, outta my way!
Papa!
Papa!
I'm so glad you came!
Where's Mama?
She complained...
Papa...
Holly... Holly.
Hey, Holly! Get off of me already!
No!
It's been forever since you've held me, Papa!
Look, you...
You're a 45-year-old woman. How can you talk like that?
Oh, now you've done it! I'm going to tickle you!
Tickle, tickle, tickle...
Hey! Stop that!
Take that and that!
What the hell are you guys staring at?
Mama...
Don't look!
I'll take your bag.
By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...
You're certain he said "evil spirit"?
Oh... my dear Jotaro!
but I clearly saw it.
I saw a separate arm...
And it grabbed the gun!
Others couldn't see it, but you could?
Yes...
but nothing strange has happened to you?
No. But Jotaro says he won't leave the cell until he knows what's going on.
What should I do, Papa?
There, there, my beloved daughter.
I, Joseph Joestar, am here now, so there's nothing to worry about.
Right.
First, I'd like to hurry
and see my grandson, Jotaro!
H-How terrifying!
He's got more stuff again...
And it's violent.
I-If anyone outside found out about this, I'd lose my job in a heartbeat.
Don't worry.
"Grandson"?
Hey, what are you planning to do?
I told you, you can't go in any further!
Convince him from over here! It's dangerous!
It's fine. Step aside! Leave him to me.
We can't be held responsible for this! Y-You...
Come now, you're in the way.
Jotaro! It's your grandfather!
I'm sure he'll be able to help you!
Please come out with your grandfather.
Get out. We're going home.
Get lost.
I didn't ask you to come here.
Help me? What the hell can you do?
but there's no way you can help me.
Bam!
Th-The pinky from my artificial left hand!
When was it torn off?
You see? Do you get it now?
Don't get close to me.
You'll just shorten what little life you have left.
H-How can this be? I don't believe it...
It was able to deceive me right off the bat...
Yes... I know exactly what Jotaro's evil spirit is.
he'll understand it much better.
Avdol, you're up.
Avdol.
Chase my grandson Jotaro out of this cell.
Don't.
He looks strong, but do you really think I'd let someone
chase me out of here just because you told him to do it?
Hell, no.
Now I'm just gonna be even more stubborn
I'll have to get a bit violent.
That's fine.
Papa, what are you doing?
H-Hey, we can't have you—
Shut up.
Yes, sir!
That's...
That's right.
An evil spirit that Avdol can control freely!
The evil spirit's name is...
Magician's Red!
I-It's hot! Fire! I'm burning! My arms are burning!
Wh-What is this evil spirit?
Kujo's plastered himself against the wall and won't move.
I don't get this at all.
B-But isn't it getting sort of...
How is it that hot?!
That's insane! It's way too hot!
There it is! It's finally shown itself!
And the fact that it's so clearly visible means it's very powerful.
Why you...
I can't believe he's able to make it manifest this clearly!
I'm surprised you have an evil spirit, too.
And Grandpa, the identity of the evil spirit...
I know it, yes.
you asked me to get your grandson out of the cell.
but considering its unexpected power, one misstep and we'll be in danger.
Shall I stop?
If you still insist that I get him out, I'll have to get violent enough
to send your grandson to the hospital.
That's fine. Give it a shot.
Yes, sir!
Red Bind!
This is...
It's so hot!
I have no idea what's going on!
Papa! What are you doing to Jotaro?!
Holly, be a good girl and keep quiet.
I-I can't breathe...
The evil spirit's withdrawing.
your evil spirit will weaken.
I shall reveal its identity!
It may seem like an evil spirit, but it is not.
Jotaro! What you believed to be an evil spirit
is a powerful vision, created from your own life energy.
Because it appears next to you, that vision is called...
A Stand!
Bam!
A Stand?
but the heat made him admit defeat.
Do you want to come out of your cage now, Jojo?
Enough of this.
The reason I won't leave
is because I keep harming others without realizing it.
Sure, it interests me that you have an evil spirit, too.
you're gonna die.
He broke the toilet!
Th-That's destruction of property!
I warned you.
Don't say I didn't warn you!
Hey!
Turn and face me!
Mr. Joestar.
As you can see, I've gotten him out of his cell.
But...
Are you saying you let me win?
Not exactly.
but I did not expect such power.
If I hadn't stopped this steel rod, what were you going to do?
My Stand is Magician's Red.
It could melt a steel rod like this in the air with ease.
Avdol has the same power as you.
You don't have to stay in that cell
to research your evil spirit any longer.
Magician's Red
Mohammed Avdol
Oh, thank goodness.
Jotaro finally came out of his cell.
You're so annoying, you bitch.
Okay!
Hey!
How dare you call your own mother a bitch, huh?!
And, Holly, stop smiling after he just called you that!
Okay!
Grandpa, there's one thing...
I'm going to ask you about one thing I don't understand.
Why did you know about my evil spirit— no, my Stand or whatever?
That's what I don't understand.
Very well.
I came all the way from New York to explain that.
But in order to explain it, I must start at the beginning.
This has to do with the Joestar family.
First, take a look at these pictures.
What are they?
Coffin?
It was apparently empty when they discovered it.
But I know exactly what was inside!
Avdol and I are trying to locate him as we speak.
Him? Hold on a sec.
You're making it sound like there was a person in there.
Why would you call something lost at sea for a hundred years "him"?
He is evil incarnate!
His name is DIO!
He has awakened from his hundred-year sleep.
We are fated to fight him!
What was that, Jotaro?!
Don't make a face like this has nothing to do with you!
G-Gramps?
Avdol, was it?
And Old Man, do you expect me to hear such a crazy story
But is it not a fact that our evil spirits are crazy, as well?
Well, whatever.
and why I'm after him...
I'll show you the reason.
What?
Old Man, what did you—
I shall show you!
This is
my Stand!
Did you see it?
Its power is to take spirit photos of visions I captured from far-off places!
Though I have to smash and destroy a 30,000 yen camera every time I do it.
Sir, is something wrong?
We're fine. Go away.
Right...
Jotaro...
will be what determines your fate!
What?
Jotaro, Holly, have either of you ever looked carefully at the back of your necks?
What do you mean?
You've probably never taken a close look.
But right around the base of my neck, there is a star-shaped birthmark.
I'll ask again. What the hell does all this mean?
and she said that my father, who died when I was young, also had it.
Apparently, those of the Joestar bloodline all have this birthmark.
I'm asking you what's going to show up on that photo.
It is our destiny, as yet undiscovered!
Papa...
Damn it, just show me what's on it already!
DIO!
And on the back of his neck...
Rumble
which that bastard has taken over!
A hundred years ago, an incident occurred in the Atlantic Ocean.
but DIO took over the body of my grandfather and survived!
And this much is certain:
He is currently hiding somewhere in the world, plotting something!
It's been four years since he came back.
The reason my spirit photos and your evil spirits
all began manifesting in this past year...
is most likely DIO!
In the wider world, our gifts are considered psychic powers.
but your powers are bound to DIO's body...
In other words, Jonathan's body, by invisible threads.
All we can say now is that DIO's existence is what brought forth
the powers that were dormant within you.
Avdol, from this photo, can you tell where he is now?
I cannot. There's hardly any background visible.
As I thought.
I'll take a closer look.
Please. Hm?
Oh, Holly.
Now, let's go home.
Y-Yes...
I will be staying in Japan for a while.
And I'll be staying at your place.
Yes, Papa.
Let's go, Jotaro.
It happened again...
Just now, it felt as though someone was watching me again.
Is it Jonathan's descendants, after all?
This body must be sending out some kind of soul signal to his descendants.
Very well. This might be called fate...
a destiny I must erase.
I have already made my move.

You forgot something!
Goodness...
Here, a goodbye kiss.
Smooch.
You bitch...
Stop clinging to your child already.
Okay! Have a good day!
Good grief...
Hey, it's Jojo.
What? Jojo?
You're right! It's Jojo!
Jojo!
Jojo!
Good morning, Jojo.
Good morning, Jojo.
Jojo!
Good morning, Jojo.
Jojo, what were you doing while you were absent from school for four days?
Hey!
Why are you clinging to Jojo's arm like that?
You're being too chummy! Stay away from him!
What the hell, ugly?
Shut it, no-boobs.
Ugly.
No-boobs.
Ugly.
No-boobs.
Ugly.

Oh, but he's moving.
The tree branches must have broken his fall!
Did the tree branches cut my leg?
No...
It was already cut before I fell!
That's why I fell down the stairs. There's no doubt about it.
But...
Jojo!
Are you all right?
Oh?
He's able to summon a pretty strong Stand.
I see...
No wonder he wants me to get rid of him.
But...
He is no match for my Stand.

Episode 2: Who Will Be the Judge!?
You really scared me.
Are you okay, Jojo?
Are you okay, Jojo?
You're really lucky.
Accidents happen all the time on these steps.
Starting tomorrow, you should hold my hand when you go down, Jojo.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
You
seem to have cut your left leg.
You should use this handkerchief as an emergency binding.
Are you all right?
Yeah. It's just a scratch.
Hold it.
Thanks.
I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.
I just transferred here yesterday.
Nice to meet you.
Huh...
Huh...
Huh...
He said his name was Kakyoin. He's not bad.
Really?
I still like Jojo better.
Me, too.
Me, too.
What?
What are you talking about?
Give it up.
I'm the best for Jojo.
At the time, I was weakened...
Because I was only a head.
If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's body...
I would have had very little.
I never could have survived at the bottom of the ocean for a hundred years.
and it seems to connect with his descendants.
They are aware of my existence.
The new power that I have acquired by obtaining Jonathan's body...
The Stand!
This Stand also affects the bodies of his descendants.
Advantages and disadvantages come hand in hand. That is inevitable.
I must eliminate them...
I must eradicate Jonathan's family.
What's the deal with this cramped room?
This is why I hate Japan.
Avdol, how can you stand this?
It is quite fascinating...
This thing they call "the tea ceremony."
Tea ceremony, nothing.
Instant coffee is plenty good!
By the way, about DIO...
wouldn't it be safe to assume that he knows about us, as well?
or even know what his powers are...
Japanese coffee tastes terrible!
That's American coffee.
Jojo, how did you get that cut?
Nurse's Office
You didn't get into another fight, did you?
And take off your hat!
It's poor manners!
For pity's sake...
Sensei, has Jojo ever gotten hurt in a fight?
There's no way that would happen.
Yeah!
Well, you've got a point.
Then I guess I'll believe that you just fell, you scatterbrain.
Hey, hold on.
What are you trying to do?
I'm cutting your pants.
Like hell you are.
Well, I can't treat you through them.
I'll take them off.
You're surprisingly stingy.
I'll take your temperatures and prove that you're faking ill.
We really have colds.
Yeah. Let us go home early.
Nope!
What is this?
Jotaro Kujo, I will kill you today with my Stand! —Noriaki Kakyoin
K-Kakyoin?
Hey... S-Sensei!
What are you doing?!
What does it look like?
Swish
I'm waving around the thermometer to reset it.
Swish
Th-Thermometer? Sensei...
Sensei, that's a pen!
A pen? Did you say a pen?!
Does this look like a pen to you?!
How... How stupid can you be?
This thermometer actually looks like a pen to you?!
Then have a...
better...
look!
Stab
She's...
Noriaki Kakyoin
My eye! My eye!
Jojo...
You're not going to say
that this looks like a pen, are you?!
How is she so strong?
This isn't a woman's strength.
I saw something unknown crawling up from the floor earlier.
Was it a Stand?
Noriaki Kakyoin...
Was he the one who cut my leg on the stairs?
Precisely.
Y-You're...
Hey. Short time no see.
My Stand's possessed that nurse and is controlling her.
Attacking my Stand will mean hurting that nurse, Jojo.
You bastard... Just who the hell are you?!
I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.
The name of my Stand is Hierophant Green.
I am human, but my loyalty is to him...
Therefore...
I shall kill you!
Bang
I won't hurt her.
Now that I've dragged it out... I see...
It's just a sleazy Stand that can't do anything but possess people.
Kakyoin, this is your Stand?
All green and striped... It looks like a shiny melon.
You're going to regret
dragging that out of her, Jojo.
Squish
Don't try to act tough.
I can see my finger marks on your forehead.
it looks like your head will be crushed, too.
I'm gonna keep a grip on you for a while.
I'll take you to the old man.
I'm sure he'd love to meet you...
And I'd like to know more about DIO myself.
What?
Green fluid is coming out of his Stand's hands?
I already told you, Jojo...
That you would regret this.
Feel the attack of my Stand, Hierophant Green!
Don't make any weird moves!
Emerald Splash!
What do you think?
Emerald Splash...
was a vision of destructive energy!
It's pierced through your Stand's chest.
Therefore, your insides have been torn to shreds.
And that nurse...
Wh-What?
I'm certain that I removed the Stand from her...
I already told you...
Attacking my Hierophant Green would mean hurting her.
My Stand can reach further than yours, but it doesn't like open spaces.
It prefers to hide within something.
If you drag it out, it gets angry.
That's why, when it came out from her throat, it hurt her.
It's your fault, Jojo!
This is your responsibility!
This is your fault, Jojo!
You did this!
If you had let me kill you in the first place, this nurse wouldn't have been hurt.
You're trying to stand up?
But how sad...
You stood back up only to be hit again.
Menacing
am labeled a punk.

so much that some are still in the hospital.
so I taught him a lesson, and he hasn't come back to school.
I leave without paying the bill all the time.
But...
Even I
know nauseating evil when I see it.
and crush them under your foot.
Especially a woman!
That is exactly what you've done!
Your Stand isn't visible to the victim or the law. Therefore...
I shall judge you!
Evil?
There, you are wrong.
Evil refers to the loser.
Justice refers to the victor.
The last man standing!
The method doesn't matter!
Grab
The loser is the evil one.
And now, the final blow!
What? The loser is evil?
Emerald Splash!
Well, in that case...
What?!
Impossible! He shrugged off the Emerald Splash?
...you're the evil one after all!
The one who'll be the judge is...
my Stand!
Smash!
What a powerful Stand...
You just caught it by surprise and hurt its chest a little.
That was close.
She should be fine once her wounds are treated.
What was that? A gas explosion?
It came from the nurse's office!
None of you leave the classroom!
I'll leave the rest to them.
I'm ditching school today.
I've got to have him explain some things about DIO.
Hierophant Green
Noriaki Kakyoin
Ping
Jotaro's totally thinking about me at school right now!
I felt like I had a connection with my son just now.
I'm not thinking about you.
Jotaro!
Wh-What about school? And who is that?
H-He's covered in blood!
D-Don't tell me... you did that?
It's got nothing to do with you.
I'm looking for the Old Man.
Sucks having to find him in such a huge house.
with Mister Avdol.
Oh, Jotaro...
You won't tell me anything.
Even though I... I...
worry about you so much.
you're a sweet boy.
Hey.
Yes?
You look a little pale this morning.
Are you all right?
Yay! Fine, thank you!
I knew it.
Well, this is no good. It's too late for him.
He's not going to make it.
He'll die in the next few days.
Jotaro, it's not your fault.
Look. The reason that this man swore loyalty to DIO
and came to kill you...
is right here!
What the hell is that?!

This isn't good at all... At this rate...

Episode 3: The Curse of DIO
It's too late for him.
He's not going to make it.
He'll die in the next few days.
Jotaro, it's not your fault.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Look. The reason that this man swore loyalty to DIO
and came to kill you...
is right here!
What is that spider-like growth?
You said that's the reason he swore loyalty to DIO?
That is a flesh bud, formed from DIO's own cells.
It connects to his brain.
This tiny little flesh bud was implanted in his brain
to influence his mind.
In other words, that flesh bud is a controller
that draws forth certain feelings.
Charisma!
The feelings that make soldiers want to obey dictators!
The feelings that make true believers follow cult leaders!
This young man admired DIO and swore loyalty to him!
which means he can sway others
He used that to order this young man, called Kakyoin, to kill us.
So operate on him and remove it.
The brain is very delicate.
Jojo.
in Cairo, Egypt.
I met DIO!
I am a fortune teller by trade.
It was the night of the full moon.
He...
stood quietly on the stairs that led up to my shop's second floor.
His cold gaze felt as if it was trying to stealthily pierce my heart.
and his strange sensuality made it hard to believe he was a man.
I had heard about him from Mr. Joestar, so I knew immediately
that he was DIO, back from the Atlantic's depths!
I hear that you have powers that ordinary people don't.
I'd be grateful if you could show them to me.
It was then that I found him truly terrifying.
His words brought such peace to my soul.
They had a dangerous sweetness.
That's exactly why he was terrifying!
Come, Avdol...
I ran for my life.
I didn't dare think of fighting him.
I was very lucky.
You would have died a few years later, your brain completely devoured.
Died?
Hold on a minute.
isn't dead yet!
Bang
I'll pull it out using my Stand!
Wait, Jotaro!
Old man, don't touch me!
I'll pull it out without harming his brain.
My Stand moves with such precision that it can grasp even a bullet.
Stop! That flesh bud is alive!
Don't you realize why part of the flesh bud is outside of his body?
That's why not even the best surgeon could extract it!
Shit!
The flesh bud stabbed him with a tentacle!
This isn't good! Let go, Jojo!
It will try to enter the brain of anyone who tries to extract it!
You...
Don't move, Kakyoin. If I fail, your brain is done for.
Let go, Jojo! It's gone up to your face!
Wait, Avdol!
My grandson is quite the man.
It's entered his body, and yet he's completely calm.
He isn't even trembling. Nor is his Stand!
He moves with more precision and strength than I anticipated.
He did it!
Overdrive!
Wh...
Why?
Why did you risk your life to save me?
Who knows?
I'm not really sure myself.
Mama sees right through you, Jotaro.
First Aid Kit
And done.
Thank you... very much.
Kakyoin, wasn't it?
You should rest for a while.
Stay the night tonight.
Huh? Um...
Papa, please get his futon ready.
Why do I have to do that?!
I've never even liked the idea of sleeping on the floor!
Holly, replace the futon in my room with a real bed!
Papa, you're in Japan, so please just get used to
Oh, and call me "Seiko."
What?!
Holly comes from the word "Holy," which is "Seinaru" in Japanese.
So all my friends call me "Seiko."
What the hell is that?!
If you don't call me "Seiko" from now on, I won't answer.
Holly!
Does it hurt, Kakyoin?
I-I'm fine.
Holly!
Good grief...
Huh?
Come on, now.
Holly!
Hmph.
Holly! Hey, Holly.
Hey, where are you?
Take a good look. These are Jotaro's pants.
Where are mine?
Hey, Holly!
Oh, I have to call her "Seiko" or she won't come out?
No, my daughter is Holly. Holly! Answer me!
I'm definitely going to go to school today.
That's weird...
Here, a goodbye kiss.
Smooch.
That's usually how it plays out...
Menacing
Bam!
Ms...
Ms. Holly!
Ms. Holly! Ms. Holly!
She's got a really high fever...
Is she sick?
This is... It can't be!
P-Pardon...
H-How can this be?
It's intangible...
It's a Stand!
A Stand has manifested from Ms. Holly, as well!
Hermit Purple
Joseph Joestar
Ms. Holly has a Stand, too.
B-But this high fever... The Stand is causing her harm.
and were relieved that Ms. Holly was unaffected.
No, we merely wanted to be relieved.
But there's no way she could be unaffected.
Anyone who has the blood of the Joestar family in their veins
should be affected by DIO.
But...
Ms. Holly is very gentle and peaceful.
She therefore lacks the strength to withstand DIO's curse.
She has no power to move her Stand.
That's why her Stand is moving against her and harming her!
This isn't good at all. At this rate...
She'll die!
She'll be killed!
Menacing
A S-Stand...
Holly...
Smash
This... This is the one thing I feared most!
M-My daughter finally has a Stand.
I knew she didn't have the power to withstand it.
I knew she didn't have the power to deny the curse from DIO's soul.
Tell me how we should deal with this!
There's only one way.
We need to find DIO!
We need to kill DIO and lift the curse! That's all we can do!
Bam
But...
No matter how many times I try, he hides in the darkness.
In every spirit photo I take, the background is darkness!
I cannot find out where he is with my spirit photos.
We've used various means to analyze them, but with this darkness, it always failed.
You should've told me that in the first place.
I might be able to find out where
Bang
that darkness or whatever is!
Did you see something in the space behind DIO?
My Stand is able to move with
Let's have him sketch.
Whoosh
Whoosh
A fly! A fly was in that space!
But a fly won't help us at all—
Wait a moment!
I've seen this fly before!
What?!
Jojo, do you have an encyclopedia?
We've got a library.
I'll take the memo.
And I'll go investigate.
Holly!
Papa, I...
Just rest. Jotaro, get some water.
You seem to be doing well.
Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.
Is it really possible for your own Stand to kill you?
It is. In the past, I have seen many people suffer that fate.
will slowly bind Ms. Holly's entire body.
and die.
A normal human
No one, not you nor I, can do anything about it.
But there is still hope.
It will take fifty days for her to reach that state.
We will find and defeat DIO before that.
Thank you, Jotaro.
Really, I wonder what's wrong with me...
I can't believe I took fever and passed out.
But...
I feel better now.
She hasn't realized what happened, since it's coming from her back.
You gave me quite the scare, Holly.
Come now. You've got to brush your teeth now that you're up.
Say, "ahh."
Ahh...
We've got to wash your face...
Your hair is a mess, too.
Then we'll take care of your nails...
Ahh...
Ahh...
Papa, help me change my underwear, too.
I'm kidding! It was a joke!
Now, then, what do you want to eat for dinner, Jotaro?
H-Hey...
Don't move! Just stay in bed!
I-I'm saying that you shouldn't do anything until your fever goes down.
Just shut up and get better soon.
Holly, come on...
You're right.
You're all so nice when I'm sick.
Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.
H-Holly!
Sh-She lost consciousness again.
She's acting cheerful, but she's burning up.
The way she acted confirms it.
Though she hasn't said anything, my daughter is aware of her Stand.
She was actually trying to hide her Stand from us.
She was trying not to worry us!
That's what kind of person my daughter is.
Mr. Joestar, I've found it!
That fly is...
Nile
Nile Ue Ue Fly (Male)
This.
The Nile Ue Ue Fly.
It dwells only within the Nile River Basin.
The ones with the stripes on their legs are known
Egypt!
And we've narrowed it down to the Aswan area.
DIO is there!
So it is Egypt...
Kakyoin.
What do you mean by that?
The flesh bud was planted in my brain three months ago.
When my family was on vacation in Egypt visiting the Nile, I met DIO.
You were in Egypt, too?
It appears that, for some reason, DIO doesn't want to leave Egypt.
When are you going?
I'll go with you.
Go with us? Why would you?
About that...
I'm not sure why I suddenly want to join you, either.
I've regained my senses because of you.
That's all.
Holly... we'll save you, no matter what.
Don't worry.
There's nothing to worry about...
You just take it easy.
Jojo's mother, Ms. Holly, is a woman who can calm the hearts of others.
People feel at ease when she is nearby.
I'd feel like I have to protect her.
I'd want to see her happy, kind smile.
Indeed.
There's no time. We're leaving immediately.
They're doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation. We can trust them.
They will take care of Holly around the clock.
Jojo, before we leave, since I am a fortune teller, I shall name your Stand.
Name?
With the cards of fate, the Tarot.
Choose a card blindly and it shall be decided.
The Star! The Star card!
Then I shall name your Stand...
Star Platinum!
Jotaro Kujo
Jotaro Kujo. Stand name: Star Platinum!
Jotaro Kujo Star Platinum
Powers: Precise movements and splendid strength!
Joseph Joestar. Stand name: Hermit Purple!
Joseph Joestar
Hermit Purple
Power: Spirit photos!
Mohammed Avdol. Stand name: Magician's Red!
Mohammed Avdol
Magician's Red
Powers: Fire and heat!
Noriaki Kakyoin. Stand name: Hierophant Green!
Noriaki Kakyoin
Hierophant Green
Powers: Long distance manipulation and Emerald Splash!
All right, we're off.
Bam
Let's go!
As I anticipated...
They have figured out my location.
Will you come here to Egypt?
Joseph and Jotaro...
He saw us.
I definitely felt DIO looking at us just now.
Yeah.
Be careful.
The next Stand user may already be on this plane.
Next Episode Preview
We've already found the next Stand user!
Impossible! It's faster than Star Platinum!
What?
It writhes in pain when torn apart.
Wow... He's so handsome!
Pardon me. Do you have a moment?
Episode 4:
Tower of Grey
I have proof of your devilish plot, Dio!
He's caught me.
But I won't run.
I came back here to fight JoJo!
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 3: Time With Dio
ADJUSTMENT	I found the antidote.
Dad just took it.
Dio, I'm heartbroken.
We were raised as brothers and now I have to turn you in.
I'm sorry.
You might not believe that, but I mean it.
That compassion is very like you.
JoJo, this is selfish, but I have a final favor to ask.
Please, give me time. Time to turn myself in.
What's this?
JoJo, how did you make it out of that slum alive?!
I'll have to distract him, then with one quick stab...
I regret my life until now!
Being poor when I was a child made me greedy!
What I did was wrong.
I tried to poison and rob the man who raised me!
I came back to turn myself in.
If I wanted to run, I could have gone anywhere!
T-That's true.
I want to make amends.
Dio --
Careful, Jonathan. Don't trust a word that snake says.
Who am I, you ask? Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Robert E. O. Speedwagon, the meddler.
I was worried about Jonathan, so I came back with him.
Since I like you, Jonathan, let me tell you something.
I was raised in squalor, and I've seen a lot of lowlifes.
My nose knows the difference between good and bad.
And this guy stinks worse than a pile of puke!
I've never met a man as wicked as him!
Wicked because of circumstance? No!
This man was born bad!
This face is familiar to you, isn't it?
This man has testified that he sold you the poison.
I've heard enough.
This is truly a shame.
I put the same love and hope into you as I did my own son.
Dad, you need to rest.
Right, I'll go to bed now.
I don't want to see my son arrested.
JoJo, do what you must.
Yes, Dad.
So this is the end?
They won't catch him.
That face and three moles on his ear...
He was born with the devil's own luck.
JoJo, I want you to be the one to handcuff me.
For our years together.
All right.
Be careful, Jonathan!
JoJo, being human means having limits.
I've learned something.
As long as you are human...
What? What do you mean?!
I'm throwing away my humanity, JoJo!
I'm moving beyond humanity!
Where did you get that?
Watch out!
Shoot him now!
I'll use your blood, JoJo!
He...
Dad!
Fire!
JoJo...
D-Dad...
I should have dodged that knife.
I let the mask distract me.
You sacrificed yourself.
Keep this.
It was your mother's.
Dad!
That wound is fatal.
How could I let that happen?!
Sir Joestar... I told you...
It's my fault. If only I had banished Dio's father.
Dio's father?
It was Dio's father, Dario Brando.
Yes, it's definitely my ring.
We had a pair made when we were engaged.
A burglar named Dario Brando was trying to pawn it.
Brando!
Sir Joestar thought he owed a life debt to Dario Brando.
But Brando was just a thief rooting around for gold at the accident site!
Oh, no!
Did he happen to tell you that I gave him the ring?
He did. What a flimsy lie!
It wasn't a lie.
I did give it to him.
I-Is that true?
He is innocent.
Let him go.
Why would you let him go?!
If I were born in his circumstances, I may have done the same.
Sell this and buy something for your family.
Then forsake criminality and walk an honest path.
Sir Joestar knew the whole truth before he adopted Dio.
Hang in there, Dad. The doctors will save you.
JoJo, please don't hate Dio.
I am responsible.
I was hard on you because you are my real son.
But in Dio's eyes, that may have been unfair to him.
That could have driven him to do what he did.
Please bury him next to his father.
Dad...
JoJo, it's not so bad...
...to die in the arms of your own son.
Sir Joestar!
What a tragedy!
No!
Sir Joestar passed his noble spirit along to Jonathan!
It has become his iron will, his pride and it will create his future!
Normally I hate spoiled crybabies.
But they are different.
They live life with no regrets. They're giants!
T-The body!
Dio Brando's body is gone!
You, cop! Get away from the window!
H-His head...
H-He's still alive!
How?! We filled him with bullets!
Watch out! I'm sure he has a weapon!
I-It can't be!
He's coming this way!
What are you waiting for?! Shoot!
Dio, stop right there!
Dio!
Hurry up and pull the trigger, Jonathan!
He's not dead, even after that.
I don't get it. I can't understand what's happening.
How could this be?!
JoJo...
This marvelous power comes from the mask, and your father's blood!
He's sucking out that man's life!
Dio, just what have you become?!
I-I'm so confused...
The knife... Dad's death... Blood... Dio... The mask...
My notes... The brain... Unknown abilities... Unknown strength...
Dio, you aren't human anymore!
Dad...
Stop! You don't stand a chance!
I've never seen the like! Anything that powerful is a monster!
You're right.
Honestly, I'm scared.
But Dio, I can't let you live like this.
It's my fault. I'll finish it!
Jonathan, stop! You'll just be killed!
The brain! The mask unlocks the brain's hidden potential!
So in order to beat Dio...
The bodies!
Warm blood...
I want to lick it all up!
You don't mind if I suck your blood, do you?
This is hard. He was my brother.
Dad, please lend me your strength.
I have to be strong. Dio is no longer human.
He's a monster!
Watch out!
I can't let Dio kill another person!
H-He caught it!
Even after it went through his hand!
Wait, the hole in his head has already healed!
He's completely immortal!
You're weak! So weak!
JoJo!
I have to play with you a bit more to test out my new powers.
Even I don't know how far they go yet.
Hiding?
Didn't I just tell you? Human schemes have their limits.
Cease your useless struggle.
Cowering behind the curtains, are we? Come on out!
It's not a scheme. It's courage!
He's regenerating while he burns!
Is that the source of his immortality?!
This fire isn't enough!
What are you doing?!
Get out of here, Speedwagon! This doesn't concern you!
You can't go up! The fire is spreading!
Jonathan, what are you planning?
Come on up, Dio!
Dio, I won't let you go beyond these walls!
Jonathan, don't!
Is he using himself as bait to protect his friend?
It doesn't matter.
I'll just use your blood to heal these burns.
Fleeing up here is useless! Falling from this high won't hurt me!
Instead, now the fire has cornered you!
Dad...
Dad, I'll miss you.
Please go to heaven along with those flames.
And then, help me accomplish my goal.
Give your strength to the fire.
What is Jonathan doing?
No! He couldn't be!
Stop! You mustn't do it!
H-Here he comes.
Utterly pathetic!
Suddenly, JoJo's youth flashed through his mind!
My youth... My time with Dio...
Now I'm going to settle the score for all that time!
He's trying to make the fire burn as hot as possible!
If the fire burns Dio faster than he can regenerate, he'll die!
So Jonathan waited for the flames to spread before going to the roof!
Don't do it!
H-How dare you!
The mansion my ancestors lived in is burning.
Dad is dead, I have nothing left. Nothing but my life.
I'll let myself burn!
I'll end your ambition in exchange for my life!
Goodbye, JoJo!
For a second there I admired your guts.
Now cry tears of joy since you can die with your dad, fool!
I'm beyond human! Invincible! Immortal! I will rule this world!
JoJo, you gave me this power!
I can't reach!
Dio, I'm back!
What?! How?!
I won't let you go!
Your fate is sealed!
Here! This is the knife you killed my father with!
I've crushed his arms to dust and he's
Very well! Let's go into the inferno together!
But you'll die alone!
I'll find a way to escape, no matter how hot it is!
Dad! Lend me your aid!
A scream! A desperate cry!
Whether at an urge from beyond or
JoJo kicked!
And across from that spot...
What the --
...was a statue of the Joestar family's guardian angel.
How could a worm like you...
I completely forgot!
JoJo!
This wasn't what my life was supposed to be.
Jonathan!
Dad...
You're alive.
You're alive!
He...
He won!
There it is.

Courage is knowing fear!
This guy's worse than Dio!

There is an emotion called fear.
It's a very natural emotional reaction found in all animals.
Why does fear occur?
and the fear born of logical thought.
Namely, when you encounter something stronger than yourself
or when you encounter something unknown.
Something as simple as "not knowing" can evoke fear.
When faced with fear, you have a number of choices.
You might struggle, resist, flee, accept, or many other things.
But upon meeting Lord DIO, a new reaction arises...
Joy!
How do people act once they feel joy in fear?
He is currently on the plane that Joestar and the others are on.
They will not reach their destination safely.
A... a rhinoceros beetle?
No...
Avdol, is that a Stand?
Are we already encountering another Stand user?
It is very possible.
It could be a bug-shaped Stand.
It hid in the shadow of the seats...
Wh-Where did it go?
Jojo! It's on the side of your head!
Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders
Episode 4: Tower of Gray
I-It's huge! It has to be a Stand.
That bug is a Stand!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
It's disgusting...
B-Be careful.
I've heard there is a user of a bug Stand that likes to rip out the tongues of its victims.
Star Platinum!
I-It dodged!
I-I can't believe it!
It's faster than Star Platinum, whose speed and precision
It has to be a Stand. That bug is a Stand!
Where is he? Where is he hiding?!
Where is the one who's controlling it?!
I-It's attacking!
No!
Jotaro!
Jojo!
Luckily, it could stop the spirit beetle's mouth needle with its teeth, but...
Since it tried to bite off Jotaro's Stand's tongue...
It must be him!
The Tower card of the Tarot...
The one that depicts a Stand suggesting
Tower of Gray.
The airplane crash that happened last year
I had heard rumors, but it seems he's working with DIO!
I-It dodged it.
I-It's so fast...
they would not be able to touch my Stand!
And you couldn't kill my Stand with a bullet anyway.
He has to be nearby!
Which one of the passengers is he?
If we can track him down...
It disappeared again.
It moved over there!
What's it planning to do?
I-It can't be!
Burst
Bingo!
Got their tongues!
And my objective...
Massacre!
This word's meaning: to kill everyone!
I-It actually did it...
I will burn it to death!
Magician's Red!
Wait! Wait a moment, Avdol!
It's so noisy...
Look out!
I guess I'll go to the bathroom.
What's this slimy stuff?
M... A...
I-Is it blood?! Blood!
Atemi.
We have to defeat it before the other passengers panic.
an active Stand like your Magician's Red
And Jojo, if your power were to put a hole in the fuselage, it'd be a catastrophe.
Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?
Stop.
You cannot catch me with your speed.
Fwish
You think so?
Emerald Splash!
Emerald Splash!
but you haven't hit me at all!
This isn't good. It's still dodging with its speed!
K-Kakyoin!
My speed is on an entirely different level.
You're way too slow to get a bingo.
And Kakyoin...
With my next attack, I'll stab your Stand's tongue with
Emerald Splash!
Don't you get it?
Th-This isn't good! It dodged Emerald Splash again!
Once this rips your tongue out, you'll go mad...
From the pain!
What? If its tongue is ripped out, it'll go mad from the pain?
 Hierophant Green?
What?!
If it rips apart, it'll go mad, all right...
From joy!
Hierophant's appendages had already slipped beneath the sheet.
Didn't you realize I was trapping you there with Emerald Splash?
So that geezer was the user?
A repulsive Stand usually has a repulsive user.
It doesn't appear that he has DIO's flesh bud in his forehead...
I'm sure DIO was able to use him because he was
Something's wrong.
I could be imagining it, but it seems like the plane is flying crooked.
It crooked.
Sir, where are you going?
The cockpit is up ahead, so passengers may not enter.
I know that.
S-Sir!
My! What a handsome man.
Move, bitch.
What a shock!
Whoa, there.
Pardon.
It is inexcusable of him to treat women in such a cruel manner...
Please forgive him.
Okay...
This is awful!
Bam!
We've been had!
Their tongues have been ripped out.
That stag beetle bastard!
He had already killed the pilots?
It's falling.
The autopilot's been destroyed, as well.
This plane's going to crash!
Splat
What?
I am the Stand that holds The Tower card
You will not reach Lord DIO!
Even if you survive this crash, you are 10,000 kilometers from Egypt!
Those who swore loyalty to Lord DIO will pursue you every hour of every day!
There are Stands in this world that you can't even imagine.
Lord DIO is the master of Stands!
Lord DIO has the power to reign over all of them.
There's no way you'll reach him!
You bastards will never reach Egypt!
You're definitely professionals.
It's a good thing you didn't scream. That would've been annoying.
Now, I've got a request.
This old man is now going to emergency land this plane on the water.
Go put life jackets and seat belts on all of the other passengers.
G-Got it!
Old man.
Well... I have experience with propeller planes, but...
Propellers?
But, Jotaro... this is my third time.
Have you ever heard of someone being in a
I'm never...
I'm never riding in a plane with you again.
Tower of Gray
Gray Fly
The plane landed 35 kilometers off the Hong Kong coast.
Jotaro and the others had no choice but to head to Hong Kong.
Today, a jumbo jet made an emergency landing
Efforts are underway to rescue all passengers.
Hong Kong!
Hong Kong Island! Kowloon! The New Territories!
— Hong Kong —
the view of the area at night is known as the "Million Dollar View."
Right. That's fine.
Please make sure the only ones aboard are us and the crew.
Right. We don't want any more victims.
Also...
Hey, big guy!
Are you guys tourists?
Want some rice porridge?
If you're in Hong Kong, you gotta try dim sum or rice porridge.
We have hot cola, too.
Rice porridge, eh? Not bad.
Did you know, Jojo?
Unlike in Japan, rice porridge is a staple food in Hong Kong.
I'll have it the popular way, with pork and a century egg.
Coming right up!
Then I'll have—
Hey!
What are you guys trying to eat?
We're going to go to my friend's shop.
Hey, dandy guy. Want to try some Hong Kong hot cola?
Hot?!
Everybody knows that cola's supposed to be cold.
Old man, who were you calling?
Hm? Oh, I'll explain everything when we get to the shop.
We need to work out a plan that'll get us to Egypt as safely and quickly as possible.
A plan?
Mr. Joestar, we cannot allow any more innocent civilians to be hurt.
The quickest way would be by plane, but...
Indeed.
we're sure to cause a disaster that will harm many people.
We'll have to get to Egypt by either land or sea.
But if we fail to meet DIO within fifty days...
I'm aware of that.
But it's too soon to worry about it.
A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a story in which
That was in the age of trains and steamboats.
As for the route...
I say we go by sea.
It'll be the Silk Road of the sea.
I believe that is best, as well.
If we go by land, borders will be a hassle.
And we'd have to cross the Himalayas and a desert.
If we ran into trouble, we'd lose a great deal of time.
There are too many dangers.
so I can't say anything.
I'll leave it up to you two.
Same.
Then it's decided.
The greatest danger will be
We'll have to do our best to get to Egypt without being spotted.
This is a sign to let them know we want more tea.
If you do this in Hong Kong, they'll bring you seconds.
Also, when they pour tea into your cup...
This means "thank you."
Excuse me, do you have a moment?
and I'm having a hard time with the kanji on the menu.
Would you please help me out?
You're annoying. Go away.
Come now, Jotaro. It's fine.
Why don't you join us?
So, what did you want to order?
Food with shrimp, duck, sharkfin, and mushrooms?
We'll have this, this, this...
And this, too.
Oh, and this.
Gong
This looks like food with beef, fish, clams, and frog, but...
Roasted Frog Rice Porridge
Clam Dish Stewed Fish
Indeed. This is rather different.
I knew this would happen.
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's on me!
It doesn't matter what you order. It's all delicious!
All right, everyone, dig in.
Wow, this is...
Well? It's pretty good, isn't it?
Well, they've certainly taken a lot of time to prepare this.
Look, these carrots...
They're shaped like stars.
It reminds me of something...
That's right.
Someone I know has this exact mark on their neck...
Menacing
You...
Are you another...
Mr. Joestar, look out!
It's a Stand!
Magician's Red!
What?!
Another Stand user!
H-His sword is so fast...
My Stand holds The Chariot card!
Silver Chariot!
Mohammed Avdol, it appears that you want to die first.
I've made a fire clock on that table!
I will kill you by the time that clock burns to twelve!

Your sword is terrifyingly fast.
It's amazing, but do you really think
Mister...?
Polnareff.
Jean Pierre Polnareff.
Merci beaucoup.
I appreciate your introduction.
But...
don't assume that my flames
It is called Magician's Red because it controls flames freely.
In the beginning, this world was engulfed in flames.
But, you say I'm being conceited?
You're saying that my swordsmanship
Foom
In the moment they lined up, he pierced five coins in a single strike!
No. Take a closer look.
That's...
I-I see... there are flames between each coin.
It appears you understand what this means.
It is not conceit.
It can slash the very air and create gaps between nothingness and nothingness.
Which means your Magician's Red is powerless before my Silver Chariot.
When did he...
but, Avdol, you'd be able to use your
It would be fitting for my Stand to defeat you under those circumstances.
A fitting victory.
All of you, outside!
Episode 5: Silver Chariot
Wh-What is this place?
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
It's Tiger Balm Garden.
What?
a garden that exists along the hillside of Hong Kong's Tai Hang Road.
Its unique taste and appearance
I will make a prediction here.
you will be destroyed by your own Stand's powers.
Avdol...
Jotaro, you need not interfere.
Come on!
Slice
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on. What's wrong?
If not, I'm going to take my turn.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
That bastard. He's mocking us.
With repeated stabs, he carved a statue that looks just Magician's Red.
You know...
You fit quite well in this garden, Magician's Red.
Suuuuuck
Here it comes.
Sounds like fun.
I'll take what you dish out.
Hey, hide behind something.
"It"?
Crossfire Hurricane!
Is that all you've got?!
I told you that my swordsmanship can create gaps
Crash
Avdol!
The flames are so strong that he's being burned, as well.
It's just as I predicted.
You will die, burned by your own flames!
Oh, good, good grief!
You're still going to come at me?
How unsightly!
What is this odd resistance?
What?!
Impossible!
How can flames come out from the body I severed?
That's not the Stand.
It's the statue!
Your eyes were blinded by the flames.
What you cut apart was the statue that Silver Chariot carved earlier.
I told you that I could control my flames freely.
The flames that you blew back toward it
You are the one defeated by his own Stand's powers.
And now, face this again!
Crossfire Hurricane!
Such terrifying power!
Since his Stand took that head-on, it must have melted. It's done for!
That's one hell of a burn.
Yeah, he's dead. If he's lucky, he'll be in serious condition.
Either way, he won't be able to stand for three months.
His Stand is destroyed and unable to fight.
Indeed.
Boom
Wh-What?
Bang
He flew into the air while still lying down!
Bravo! Oh, bravo!
H-He's...
I don't believe it!
He's perfectly fine!
But why is his body floating in the air?
Take a good look with your inner eye.
That's...
Bam
Yes, this is it.
You could even call it a surprise attack.
Would you give me the time to explain?
Very well.
Let's hear this explanation.
My Stand did not break apart and disappear.
Silver Chariot was wearing armor. That's what it just took off.
What was burned away by your flames was just part of its armor.
That's why I was only lightly injured.
And with its armor off, it is lighter.
Did you see it lift me up?
That's right. That's how fast it can move now!
I see.
But that would also mean that it's naked now.
Oui, precisely.
But that would be impossible.
Impossible? I'd like to test that theory.
Because I'm going to show you something astonishing.
Oh? Go right ahead.
Line-up
Wh-What?!
His Stand just multiplied into six... no, now there are seven of them!
I-Impossible.
It seems that you are astonished.
Shadow clones of my Stand that confuse not only your eyes, but your senses.
Your senses can't follow its movements.
How do you like its swordsmanship now?
Silver Chariot
Jean Pierre Polnareff
Red Bind!
I told you that you wouldn't be able to follow its movements.
Your flames can only grasp shadow clones.
Striking at random now?
You're getting a bit desperate, Avdol.
It's true; that'll just use up all his energy.
Crossfire Hurricane!
Non, non, non, non, non, non.
That is also a shadow clone.
Your attack will not work against my Stand.
Come on, come on, come on!
Avdol!
Such precision. Th-This is...
a Stand ability that has been very highly trained.
For certain reasons, I trained for nearly ten years.
Now, come at me again.
I will finish you with my next move.
In the name of chivalry, you keep explaining your attacks.
You're rather honorable.
Therefore, I shall also
reveal a secret before beginning my next attack.
Oh?
You see, there are variations to my Crossfire Hurricane.
It is a flame in the shape of an Ankh, but it need not be singular.
I can break it up and make it fly in pieces.
Crossfire Hurricane
Special!
Just try and dodge it!
You waste your time, Avdol!
They formed a circle!
There's no opening!
Naïve! Naïve, naïve, naïve, naïve!
You're naïve!
I will again use this power against you!
Sever! Blow it back at him!
What?!
That's...
The hole that was made by the flames earlier...
I get it!
And then he shot the Crossfire Hurricane through it!
I told you.
Burning is a rather painful way to die.
I was conceited.
I'll be a good sport and burn to death after all.
Since I was defeated by your powers, it is only due courtesy.
It would be disrespectful to kill myself.
Even now, you remember to be chivalrous.
And you did not throw your dagger when I had my back turned.
Despite having orders from DIO, your proud honor shines through.
It would be a shame to kill you.
There must be a reason behind his actions...
Jojo!
Yeah.
Ugh. Those tentacles are so gross!
Jotaro, hurry up and get it out.
Shut up, old man.
Hurry! Hurry!
Kakyoin, don't guys like him who make stupid puns
The boat that we had chartered from the Speedwagon crew
Polnareff?
I haven't thanked you for freeing me from DIO's spell yet.
For that, you need to thank Jojo.
Don't need it.
It appears there's no one to accept your kind thanks.
All right. I don't like to be pushy, either.
But there is something else.
Monsieur Joestar, I'd like to ask you a very bizarre question.
A bizarre question?
Your left arm wouldn't happen to be a right arm, would it?
What? My left arm, a right arm?
That is indeed a bizarre question.
What do you mean?
I'm looking for the man who killed my younger sister.
I don't know his face.
I lost it in a battle fifty years ago.
I apologize for my rudeness. Please forgive me.
If you don't mind, tell us what happened.
It's been three years now...
My younger sister was walking home from school
It was a country road in my native France.
On the side of the road, a man stood
And then...
My sister was shamed and killed.
That was all that man wanted.
Barely escaping death, her friend somehow survived.
No one believed her testimony, but I understood it!
Because I believed that man may have a similar power to the
He's definitely a Stand user.
I swore!
My sister's soul would not be able
I will use my Stand for retribution!
Menacing
Then, a year ago, I met DIO.
Blam
I see s-something in the crystal ball.
It's...
A vision. I didn't create it.
What's inside your heart is being projected via my powers.
How about it?
Would you like to be friends with me?
Something is bothering you. You're in pain.
Stick with me, and it'll disappear from your heart.
What's being shown in the crystal is what pains you, yes?
Let me help you.
I have pain of my own...
My body cannot go out into the sunlight.
So please, help me, as well.
I shall find this man for you.
And then I was ordered to kill you.
I believed that was the right thing to do.
it would appear that DIO has found the man with two right arms
I've decided to go to Egypt with all of you!
What should we do?
I have no objections.
I'm sure you'd follow us, even if we said no.
Jean Pierre Polnareff.
Jean Pierre Polnareff
Stand name: Silver Chariot.
Silver Chariot
Powers: Fast and precise swordsmanship!
It's an honor.
Good grie—
Excuse me!
Would you mind taking our picture?
He's amazing.
I'm going to use this as my chance.
Thank you!
We want our backs toward the ocean.
You're annoying me! Ask someone else!
Now, now, now, now...
I'll take your picture for you.
Come, come.
You have very nice legs. Let's get a full body shot.
Ooh, nice!
Très bien!
I don't quite understand his personality.
That was a very sudden change of mood.
More like his head and his lower half are very clearly separated.
Good grief.

In order to save Holly, Jojo and crew head toward faraway Egypt.

Ho Chi Minh
heading first to Singapore.
Singapore
we'll be on the water for three full days.
Well, let's relax and keep our spirits up.
But seriously, guys...
Can't you do something about those school uniforms?
You're going to continue our journey wearing those?
Isn't it ridiculously hot?
Well, we are students...
And students should behave as students.
But I suppose that sounds like a stretch...
Hmph.
Hmph! Japanese students are such stiffs.
I see... so this is Bushido.
Once you clear your mind, even fire seems cool.
But you know, girls won't fall for stiffs like you.
Let go! Let go of me! You big lug!
Shut up!
Damn it, let me go! Let me go!
What a little brat.
Hey, what's going on?
I thought we agreed there'd be no passengers on our boat.
Let go!
I'm sorry. It's a stowaway.
This brat was hiding in storage down below.
A stowaway?
Come at me if you're gonna!
I'll kick your balls in!
I'll turn you in to the naval police.
What? The police?!
P-Please. Let me go!
I just want to go see my dad in Singapore.
I'll do anything! You can work me as hard as you want!
Let's see. What should I do?
Should I let you go?
What should I do?
P-Please!
What should I do?
Ow!
I'm not gonna let you go after all. Hell no.
First, I'm gonna go let the Captain know, so come wit—
Whoa! He jumped in! Talk about energetic.
Is he planning to swim to shore from here?
What should we do?
Just leave 'im.
I'm sure he dove in because he's a confident swimmer.
Th-This isn't good! Sharks gather around these parts!
This isn't good!
Hey, you brat! Come back!
Get back here! It's dangerous!
There are sharks! Those waters are shark-infested!
Huh?
Crack!
Good grief, you little brat.
You're...
A girl?
And a little runt of one, at that.
H-How dare you grab my chest like that?!
Damn it!
Good grief.
J-Jotaro! Below you!
Something's attacking from underwater!
It's not a shark! It's really fast!
Jotaro! Hurry!
Hurry and swim to the boat!
I-It's too far.
If it's at that distance, leave it to me.
Hierophant Green!
I-It disappeared! It's a Stand!
That thing is a Stand!
A seafaring Stand...
I don't believe I've ever even heard of such a thing.
This girl... Sh-She couldn't be...
Could she be that Stand's user?
Could she have led Jojo into the shark-infested ocean on purpose?
all glaring at me like that?!
but do you want a fight?!
Don't underestimate me! I'll take you on!
One-on-one!
Face me, one-on-one!
You little shits!
She can't be serious.
Maybe we should toss her back into the ocean.
Don't be rash.
she'd have been eaten by sharks.
I've already checked the ten people on this boat.
I don't know who it could be, other than this girl.
Isn't there a way we can find out who she really is?
Hey, how's DIO doing?
DIO? What the hell is that?
Don't act like you don't know, you little brat!
You damn punks!
Do you want to talk to me, or do you want to get stabbed?
Which is it?!
This demon's blade is telling me that it wants
the blood of its 340th victim already.
What's so funny, you stupid grunt?!
Grunt?
You know, I really don't think it's her.
Yes, but...
So is this girl our stowaway?
Captain.
I'm pretty harsh when it comes to stowaways.
O-Ow... Ow...
we'll just get more and more stowaways.
We're gonna hold you in
one of the rooms below deck until we get to port.
Captain, I'd like to ask you something.
You've verified the identities of all ten of the men on board, right?
Of course.
All of them are veterans who have been on this boat
for over ten years.
I'm not sure why you're so worried about that.
By the way...
I request that you refrain from smoking aboard this ship.
What did you plan to do with the ashes and butt after you're done?
Were you planning on throwing it into the beautiful ocean?
Mr. Outlaw.
Got it?
Hold it.
If you're going to put it out, just put it out.
Don't be a condescending prick about it, you jackass.
Hey, Jotaro! Don't be rude to the captain!
You're the one at fault.
I'm very aware that I'm being rude.
He isn't the captain... I just figured it out.
He's the Stand user!
Wh...
What?!
Sta... nd?
What might that be...?
That's inconceivable, Jotaro.
Captain Dragon came recommended with verification by the Speedwagon Foundation.
He's someone we should trust.
There is a 0% chance that he's a Stand user.
Hold on, a Stand? I have no idea what you're talking about...
Jojo, random guesses will only make things more confusing!
Do you have any proof, Jojo?
I've found a way to differentiate Stand users from other people.
What?!
That is...
a vein pops up on the tip of their nose.
What the hell are they all doing?
You can't be serious, Jotaro!
Yeah, I'm lying.
But it looks like we've found the idiot.
Menacing
Jotaro, how did you know he was suspicious?
Actually, I didn't think he was at all.
Huh?
But I planned to try this with all of the men on board.
You're cold. Damn, but you're cold.
You're right. I'm not the captain.
The real captain is already sleeping with the
fishes at the ocean's bottom back in Hong Kong.
Then you can sleep at the bottom of Hell!
Grab
Damn it!
Splash
I-I can't move...
Trouble on the water! Lies and betrayal!
The Moon card, which suggests fear of the unknown.
Its name: Dark Blue Moon!
so I was going to hide my identity and take care of you one by one...
But if you've figured me out, I guess I have no choice.
I'll have to take on all five of you!
Getting my hands on this girl is a sign
that my luck is changing for the better!
I'm going to jump into these shark-infested waters with her.
Of course, you guys will end up following us in.
where I have the advantage, I can beat all five of you.
Don't underestimate me by taking a hostage!
Don't think that I, Jotaro Kujo, will be shaken by this!
Underestimate? No, this is a prediction!
I hear that your Stand, Star Platinum, is pretty damn fast.
but my Dark Blue Moon is pretty fast in the water.
It can swim more elegantly than any fish in the sea!
Why don't we test them out?
Follow me... if you're prepared to choke to death on all the seawater
you're about to swallow.
Crush
H-He attacked faster than we could fall... That's impossible...
You're the only one who's going to choke on seawater.
Avdol, say something.
You tried to out-predict me, a fortune teller...
...but it's ten years too early for you.
Star Platinum
Jotaro Kujo
He's drifting away.
but it looks like he was just an idiot.
Jotaro, what's wrong? Hurry and lift up the girl!
What's wrong, Jotaro?!
D-Damn it... I'm being pulled in...
Th-These are...
Acorn barnacles! The crustaceans called acorn barnacles!
They're all over Star Platinum's arm and on the side of the boat!
He's still planning on fighting.
He attached them to me earlier, when I hit him.
They keep multiplying!
My Stand's strength is being drained...
H-He suddenly disappeared.
The captain, he's nowhere to be found!
Jotaro! Bring in your Stand!
which is why I'm sweating way more than I want to right now!
Jojo!
Jotaro!
Shoom
Jojo!
C-Crap!
Th-This isn't good!
Welcome! Welcome!
the undersea realm.
It's a bad idea to underestimate me, boy.
the Stands can still communicate, so go ahead.
Try to sound all cocky, like you did earlier.
Go ahead, boy!
So what do you want to be?
Tell me what kind of fish dish you want to be.
Fish cakes? Or maybe sashimi?
I'll make a meal out of your Stand.
but inside, this is what you're thinking:
"How long can he stay underwater?"
but can he last longer than me?"
Let me answer you.
My lung capacity is three times greater than a normal person's!
And I've trained them.
My best time underwater is 6 minutes and 21 seconds!
I'm sure you're getting dizzy just hearing that number.
And!
Dark Blue Moon's fins are
underwater cutters that move sharper than a ship's propeller!
take a good, hard look at your Stand!
The acorn barnacles I attached to it will keep absorbing your power to propagate.
I'm sure you can feel your power draining away.
Trying to run away by swimming back up?
Take a good look around you!
Haven't you realized that Dark Blue Moon has been
creating an underwater whirlpool, boy?
Swim! Swim!
and your power is still draining!
But it's too early to kill a
self-absorbed little brat like you just yet!
I-It's been too long! He's still not coming up!
A whirlpool!
There's a giant whirlpool!
Where the hell is Jojo?!
Let's go save him!
Th-These are scales!
Th-That guy's Stand has scales as sharp as razors!
There are countless scales swirling in that whirlpool.
He wasn't bluffing when he said he could beat all five of us.
That whirlpool is like a watery ant lion pit!
It's very possible we could all die if we dive in.
H-His scales?
And now I'm going to guess what you're thinking next!
"In a whirlpool, only one spot stays still."
So mundane!
"It's the center!"
"If I jump into the center where he is, I can attack him."
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
come at me.
its power drained by the acorn barnacles.
See if you can manage an attack
that's even sharper than these underwater cutters, boy!
C-Curses... It's too reckless to act.
It's Jojo!
I could see Jojo in the whirlpool!
This isn't good!
He was limp!
Limp? He wasn't struggling at all?
That might be a good thing.
What?
How dare you say you were going to turn me into sashimi?!
The one that's going to be sliced up like sashimi is...
Star Finger!
Wha...
Slice
The one who was turned into sashimi was you, after all.
Blub, blub, blub, blub...
What's that? I can't hear you very well since we're underwater.
Speak up!
But your power was being drained...
You let yourself go limp on purpose
to concentrate your power in your fingers...
Th-That's what you were thinking...
Nope. What I was thinking was...
old man.
Jojo!
That's my grandson for you!
Well done, Jotaro! Hurry and come u—
Th-That captain had planted some bombs after all!
Damn it!
Hurry up and get the emergency boats out!
We'll signal a nearby boat for help!
Dark Blue Moon
Fake Captain Dragon
Have some water.
We've sent signals for help, so someone should be here soon.
I don't know what in the world is going on, but who are you people?
We're hurrying along a journey, just like you.
while I'm on one for my daughter.

Hey! That's our precious water!
How dare you spit it out?!
N-No... E-E...

Perhaps.
What concerns you?
The Joestar bloodline.
Joestar? Those two? They are mere trash.
They are no match for your Stand!
Yes...
To be more specific...
It is not the Joestars that I fear.
It is the fact that I cannot underestimate the Joestar bloodline.
I feel that I must rid the Joestars from my wheel of fortune.
You thought to eliminate them yourself simply because you feel
Yes.
Foolishness!
You need not worry about taking action yourself, Lord DIO.

A-A freighter!
I didn't see it at all.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Do you think there might be
No, I was just wondering why
They came this far to rescue us!
There has to be someone aboard!
Even if they're all Stand users, I'm getting on this boat.
Grab on. I'll help you up.
Good grief.
Wh-What's with this boat?!
There's no captain in the pilothouse!
There's no operator in the radio room.
There's no one anywhere!
And yet, look!
Maybe they're all in the bathroom with a bad case of diarrhea.
Hey! Isn't anyone around?
Everyone, come over here!
A monkey!
There's a monkey inside that cage.
An orangutan.
Who the hell cares about a monkey?!
Let's split up and find whoever's been feeding it.
Well?
It doesn't appear to be broken, but...
Avdol! That sailor's in danger!
Good grief.
B-But no one was touching it...
I saw that crane move, even though there was no one operating it!
Th-That crane impaled him on its own!
Be careful! There's someone here.
Hey! Don't touch any of the machinery.
If it moves or runs on electricity, don't lay a finger on it!
If you want to live, follow my orders.
Don't leave the cabin down below until we say it's okay!
Did anyone see even a glimpse of a Stand just now?
No...
My apologies...
All right. I will have my Hierophant Green look around.
Are you guys jinxes?
Is that what you are?
I have just one bit of truth for you.
We are on your side.
Make sure you stay with the others. Got it?
Okay.
You want me to open the cage?
I can't.
You're giving me an apple?
But it doesn't make sense...
It was just cut.
Hey, so there is someone somewhere on this boat, right?
Do you know where the person who feeds you is?
Scratch
Y-You're a pretty smart monkey, aren't you?
Is a monkey like you actually into looking at
Hey, be careful!
Come on. Stay with us in the room on the other side.
Don't go off by yourself.
O-Okay...
It's inconceivable.
We've searched every pipe and crevice, but nothing!
Well?
I-It's no use. I can't get a connection.
Well, try one more time!
I'm all sticky from the salt water...
Hey!
Jojo!
Here's your lock!
This ape... is no ordinary ape.
Could it be that he's...
Slice
I-Is he the one that removed the fan?
So this ape's a Stand user.
Why can't I see it?
What?
Jojo!
Wh-What is this?
Once again, I can't see the Stand, and yet the window broke.
Star Platinum!
What's with this thing?
The ape sank into the wall and disappeared!
Hey. You saw that, didn't you?
The ape vanished into the wall...
But that orangutan has to be the Stand user...
But why can't I see the Stand?
But... if I can see it, that would mean...
Wh-What?
Wh-What is this?!
C-Crap!
Th-This is...
Is this freighter...
C-Could it be that the ship itself is...
So the Stand is the freighter!
C-Crap!
All of it! Everything! This ship itself is a gigantic Stand!
The ship?!
We would have to assume
But it must demand tremendous power to operate such a gigantic Stand.
Kakyoin! Use Hierophant Green and contact Jotaro!
I-I can't!
So this is what it means to face certain doom.
We were already hopelessly ensnared.
The pressure is getting greater...
At this rate, our bodies will be torn apart.
E-Everyone will be...
W-We were careless...
The word that the orangutan was pointing to was "strength."
It means force, energy, power, or aid.
And... it is the eighth card of the Tarot!
The eighth card of the Tarot. It suggests challenge, powerful will, and hidden instinct.
It suggests challenge, powerful will, and hidden instinct!
Ba-Bang
This ape thinks it's already won.
"This ship, the entire thing, is my Stand!"
"You can't do anything!"
That's what it's saying.
That button's not part of your Stand.
You mad?
No, it's not hurt...
Graaaa
That's exactly what makes you an ape.
What's going to hurt...
is your head!
Good grief.
So you're asking me to forgive you?
But you've already broken the rules of being an animal.
So I don't think so.
Wham! Wham! Wham!
It's distorting... The whole ship is twisting up!
Hey. Be surprised later.
This ship's about to sink.
We're gonna get out of here, by the boats we came in on.
I-I can't believe it.
Unbelievable...
What terrifying power.
We were completely overwhelmed.
But are we going to encounter even more Stands with
Want some gum?
So we're going to be drifting again.

Hey, you!
You! I'm talking to you!
Huh?
You! You threw this trash, didn't you?
That's a fine of five hundred Singapore dollars!
What? Five hundred?
In Singapore, the law says you will be fined for littering!
Five hundred Singapore dollars...
That's about 40,000 yen.
Trash?
Got it?
Trash?
What are you talking about?
I don't see anything here besides my own luggage.
Would you be so kind as to tell me what trash you're referring to?
Where is this trash, sir?
That's your luggage?
That's right.
I-I'm terribly sorry.
Well, I'll be going, then...
Shoo, shoo.
What's with the kid? She's still following us.
Hey, weren't you going to go see your father?
Why don't you stop following us and get going?
I'm meeting up with him in five days.
I'm not taking orders from you guys.

Maybe she doesn't have any money.
All right...
I guess we can pay for her hotel room.
Polnareff, bring her, but don't hurt her pride.
Got it.
Hey!
You're poor, right?
Well then, let us check in...
R-Right...
I'm terribly sorry, but we are rather full at this time of year.
The rooms won't be next to each other. Is that all right?
Well, I guess we don't have a choice.
Then for the rooms...
Avdol and I will share a room...
Jotaro and I will share a room, since we're both students.
That would mean the last room would be Polnareff and...
You're joking! Like I'd room with him!
What?
Well, she is a child, but also a lady...
Could you make it four rooms?
Hmph! I can relax more in my own room anyway!
Nothing would suit me better!
Let's go.

Anyway, listen! He's completely baffling.
I can't tell if he's strong or weak...
H-He was just creepy!
He ran away... damn it, what the hell?
Don't let your guard down! My leg's suddenly been cut open.
Soul Sacrifice, who suggests The Devil?
You're positive that's what he said?
Yeah. But no matter how much I think, it still doesn't make sense.
I know for a fact that I saw a glimpse of his Stand.
Anyway!
I'll be there in five minutes.
Room 1212, on the twelfth floor, right?
Contact Kakyoin and Jotaro for me, too! Later!
This is the front desk.
Hello? Room service?
I hurt my leg a bit...
Could you bring up some kind of medicine and some bandages?
This is Polnareff in room 912.
Understood. We'll bring it up immediately.
Aw, man...
I got hurt in the pants that I hadn't washed or even worn yet.
Do you know about the one who attacked Polnareff, Avdol?
Indeed.
Soul Sacrifice.
An assassin who claims to be a Native American medicine man.
But he's a terrifying Stand user.
Mafioso, militaries, and politicians
I've seen Soul Sacrifice once before.
He controls his Stand through the power of its grudge against that attacker.
That's why, to ordinary people, it seems like a curse killed the victims.
And Polnareff fell for that?
Sadly, yes.
What kind of Stand does he use?
No one knows.
Right now, it's dangerous to leave Polnareff alone.
So he might be able to pick us off, one by one...
He'll be here in five minutes.
Got it. We'll all meet up in room 1212, old man.
What's going on, Jojo?
Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.
That's weird. I can't find my room key.
I could have sworn I set it here...
Damn it! Where is it?
If I don't have my key, I won't be able to get back in here.
Could I just tell the front desk?
Is there a fine for that?
There it is. Must've fallen during all the commotion earlier.
Wha...
What?!
Wh-What's...
I-Is this shampoo?! Damn it! My eyes!
Who's there?!
Th-This isn't good!
Mr. Polnareff, this is room service.
I've brought your medicine.
Get away! You'll be killed!
Huh? Wh-What has happened here?!
Get out of here! I told you, you'll be killed!
Loom
Slam
How dare you?!
How dare you stab one of my eyes out, Polnareff?!
A doll?! That's the...
Silver Chariot!
Are you stupid?!
Your Stand isn't one that can fight where you can't see!
Ebony Devil
Soul Sacrifice
Oh, Jojo.
Did you need something?
So you are here.
Listen up. Don't leave this room for a while.
Huh?
I'll come for you again later.
Don't open the door to any stranger, got it?
O-Okay...
Stab
Damn it! How heavy is this bed, anyway?!
It's at least 120 kilograms...
I have to use Silver Chariot to cut this cord...
Y-You bastard!
As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.
Even if I can't see, I'm just gonna have to keep stabbing away!
You suck!
Looks like even a knight can't cut open a watermelon
Talk about dense!
You bastard...
Give a rest already...
You little shrimp!
It's just you two?
What happened to the girl?
Well, we went to check on her...
But she's not a Stand user, so we thought that
Good point. So that just leaves Polnareff.
But man, is he late...
It's already been way over five minutes.
Let me go!
I've caught you.
All right.
Damn it... But a-at least I finally managed to cut the cord...
I need to return Chariot under the bed and get the hell out of here.
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!
Huh?
Hey, Polnareff!
What an obscene guy.
Chariot!
Whoa, there.
I'm gonna run off to a place you can't see now.
You numbskull!
Try giving the floor you're stuck to a good feel.
Th-This is...
It's soaked with beer, juice, and alcohol!
I spilled them on purpose!
And now... what do you think I'm gonna do with this
Polnareff?
I'm not gonna dry you off!
Die!
This should take care of my grudge...
You're not the only one who's been scattering stuff around!
H-How did you know where I was on top of the bed...
so precisely?!
I broke a mirror!
At last, we meet.
Whoa, there.
Hey, Soul Sacrifice.
I have a question for you.
I'm looking for a man with two right arms.
How about you tell me who that guy's Stand is?
You idiot! No assassin reveals their Stand's identity!
The only time they reveal it is when they or their opponent is dying!
we already know all your weak points!
If it weren't for that mirror, I would have killed you by now!
All right. Come at me one more time.
What's wrong?
Just try it, you vulgar little shit!
Bang
I'm gonna...
slice up everything your balls!
Ka-ba-ba-bang
Gyaaah
Excuse me, sir.
Soul Sacrifice
Bam
Soul Sacrifice's... Last Moments
Polnareff, you're finally here.
You're not very punctual.
All right, everyone. We're gonna get right to it.
I-I'm so tired...
Silver Chariot
Jean Pierre Polnareff
Answer me!
And the dead body that was in the bathroom...
Answer me!
I have the right to remain silent.
You're finally here! I've been waiting for you.
I had the Speedwagon Foundation take some measures.
Polnareff should be released soon enough.
But that was close.
To think that the enemy's pursuit would come so early...
he'll know about everything that Jotaro and I do.
That's why he keeps coming after us without a moment's rest.
But on the other hand, we're able to read DIO's thoughts, too.
I'll go buy a Polaroid camera.
You don't have to do that.
What?
Michael's not here yet? Where's Michael?
This week's number three jumps up five points from last week...
The price of gold today is...
You look delicious, meow.
The channels seem to be changing chaotically.
It's trying to connect words from the TV into a sentence.
It's more spirit audio than spirit photo.
There...

I-Impossible. Kakyoin is DIO's servant?
This is...
you're watching, aren't you?!
DIO!
He found us! Look out!
B-But what does that mean?
It's just as you heard.
It can't be!
I trust Kakyoin.
There must be a reason.
he could take our heads while we're sleeping at any time.
He'd be DIO's Trojan Horse!
Where is Kakyoin?
He's with Jotaro.

Hey, Jotaro. Are you going to eat that cherry?
Hey, what are you doing, Kakyoin? They'll die!
Could he really be a traitor?
A back-breaker? Such a drastic move!
This is unforgivable, isn't it?

Where's Kakyoin?
He's with Jotaro.
Can I get some ice cream?
Welcome.
ice cream is good, but this is tasty, too.
It's chilled coconut juice.
I guess we can try it.
Give us three.
Thanks. That'll be twelve dollars.
Hey, make that six dollars.
This should cover it.
Okay.
Thanks!
I'll take that!

You thought you could get away with stealing my wallet, you little shit?
Huh?
Cough up your guts!

Kakyoin!
Why, you...
You're worth about as much as a sewer cockroach's dick.
The idea that...
Choke
you thought you could steal my wallet with
Crack
Snap
the same fingers that wipe your filthy ass...
I can't let you get away with that, can I?
Hey! What are you doing, Kakyoin?
A-Amazing. A back-breaker?
And he's using such filthy language...
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Kakyoin!
Didn't you hear me tell you to stop?!
Kakyoin, you bastard.
Something's wrong with you.
That hurt...
You didn't have to push me like that.
That guy tried to steal my wallet, which makes him a very bad person.
Of course I should punish him.
Am I wrong, Jotaro?
He's...

What are you glaring at?
The look in your eyes is awfully hard, Jotaro.
You couldn't be
planning to part ways with me just because
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Hey, a rhinoceros beetle.
Awesome!
A rhinoceros beetle? Where?
There're four of them up there.
I see them!
Awesome!
don't think so hard about this.
I'm just a bit annoyed today.
The trip's exhausted me and left me in a bad mood.
You're in a bad mood?
Seemed to me you felt pretty good.
The old man and Avdol think it's a good idea to head to India by train.
We're leaving tomorrow.
We're taking a cable car to Singapore Station to reserve tickets.
Mr. Kakyoin...
Jojo's getting further ahead.
R-Right. I'll catch right up.
I guess you like coconut juice a lot, huh, Mr. Kakyoin?
Huh?
Th-That was a rhinoceros beet—
N-No. I must have seen it wrong.
It must have been a fiber from the coconut or something.
Yes. I love coconuts.
Is something wrong?
I-It's nothing.
Hey, Jotaro.
If you're not gonna eat it, give it to me.
I'm starving.
Uh-oh! Look out, Jotaro!
Jojo!
Kidding!
dear Jotaro.
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...
I-It's like Kakyoin-san's a totally different person!
There you go again!
Jotaro, my buddy?
Get on, Kakyoin.
The cable car is here.
Here, I've got a ticket for you.
Wham!
What?!
That's not quite right.
"Possessed" isn't quite right.
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...
That's not Kakyoin!
Haven't you realized that my body's been getting bigger?
Who are you?
A Stand?
Is there a Stand that I can actually hit?
Jojo!
I combine with any flesh that I consume.
So I'm a Stand that normal people can see and even touch.
I'm Yellow Temperance, of the Temperance card.
This is my true, handsome face!
Come on, Jotaro, my buddy!
Take a look at your hand.
There's a little bit of me there from when you hit me.
Let me warn you.
If you touch that, it'll go after your left hand, too.
Go ahead and pick your nose with that left hand!
This is a Stand that devours things slowly...
The more it eats, the bigger it gets.
D-Damn you...
Come on!
Whaddya mean, "come on"?!
While I'm digesting you, I'll be sure to stuff your mouth with your own shit!
I-It burns.
Y-You bastard...
Oh, J-Jojo's grandpa? There's trouble!
Anne? What's wrong?
M-Mr. Kakyoin is...
Kakyoin?!
Did he actually betray us?
Mr. Kakyoin's face split apart!
But Mr. Kakyoin wasn't actually Mr. Kakyoin!
And...
Jojo's in the cable car and there's
Calm down! Where are you right now?
The cable car station near the trade center!
He's being attacked!
Mr. Kakyoin is attacking Jojo!
Hurry and come back to the hotel—
Did someone say my name?
Where have you been?
Jojo left me behind, so I was sunbathing by the pool.
With your school uniform on?
Yes. So?
It's all right. He's the real one!
Which means, Anne, your Kakyoin is...
a fake!
I know that!
Jojo!
Jojo just jumped out of the cable car!
Star Platinum
Jotaro Kujo
G-Good grief.
A Stand that combines with flesh?
It's devouring my finger...
I need to do something about this Stand.
If worse comes to worst, I might have to chop off my finger.
Do you really think you got away?
Well, I guess I'd better tell you.
Get a straw, suck out all the gunk in your ears, and listen up.
My Stand, Yellow Temperance, has no weaknesses.
It's not that you ran away.
you little shit!
It'll burn me, too, but I guess I'll burn it to death.
This...
It just made it spread!
Heating it is a bad idea...
Damn it.
Pardon.
Oh, my. Talk about a strange entrance.
Don't mind me.
Hey, kid. Lemme see your ice pop for a sec.
Hey! What are you doing to that boy's ice pop?
Is this your kid?
No.
Then shut up and enjoy the scenery.
Sorry. When we get to the ground, I'll buy you a new one.
'Kay.
If I can't heat it...
That bastard!
N-Now it's forming needles and digging deeper into my hand!
Hey, you! Fire and ice won't work at all.
I told you. It doesn't have a weakness.
You little shit!
Papa! The puppy! The puppy!
You bastard! You were already in this cable car?
M-My Pocky!
It's dangerous! Don't pull!
Let go!
I'm here to finish you off...
Jotaro, my buddy!
You're fast! But...
Like I keep telling you, I don't have any weaknesses!
Are you even listening to me?
You dumbass redneck!
My Stand is essentially an armor that consumes power.
A barrier that attacks!
it's absolutely useless before Yellow Temperance!
You can't defeat me!
You can't even run, unless you cut off your right hand!
Do you understand?!
You have no way of winning!
You can't get away!
Good grief.
This thing really doesn't have a weakness.
It could be the most powerful thing ever.
How terrifying.
But the Kujo family... No.
The Joestar family has its own philosophy
I still have
just one strategy left.
What?
That's...
That's...
...to run away!
What the hell?!
My Stand's got a hold of you that you can't escape, and you say you'll run?
I may be running...
But I'm running into the water.
I-I can't breathe...
You opened your Stand's guard so you could breathe.
Do you understand?
You sure said all the crap you wanted to back there.
I'm the type that takes such things to heart.
Crush
S-Stop...
I can't recover anymore!
My nose is broken.
They're going to have to wire my jaw, too.
DIO bought my services.
I don't plan to risk my life going after you people.
There! See?
How about you talk?
Tell me about the Stand users that are planning to attack us.
Th-That's the one thing I can't say.
I have some pride.
I can't rat out my own side...
I see. Well, that's honorable.
I remember now!
I see. And what are their powers?
I-I don't know.
N-No, really! I really don't know!
because it'd expose their weaknesses.
B-But there is some witch who told DIO about Stands...
And her son is among the four.
His name is Centerfold.
He's a man with two right hands.
He's the one that killed Polnareff's sister, isn't he?
I've heard a rumor about his powers...
A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.
He's gonna die.
I just realized, Jotaro...
But it looks like the goddess of fortune is still on my side.
See that drain?
Take a good look.
A manhole...
That little drain
I'm gonna pull you in and hold you there!
Now you can't attack me!
Looks like what I told you
Jotaro Kujo!
Man, am I ever lucky!
I even ate some crayfish and powered up.
I'll crush you up
If I kill you, DIO will give me a hundred million dollars.
To think I can make that much from a few minutes of fighting.
Don't you think I'm pretty lucky?
Good grief.
It's rather hard to observe yourself.
Haven't you realized you were only lucky up until now?
Before, you only suffered a broken nose.
That was when you were truly lucky!
Crush
A water pressure punch... f-from inside the drain?!
I-I was just kidding, Mr. Jotaro!
I was just messing with ya! I didn't mean anything by it.
Come on, now. Did you take it personally?
Y-You're not thinking of hitting me any more, are you?
I'm a seriously injured man...
I have nothing more to say to you.
You're too pathetic
to talk to any more.
Yellow Temperance
Rubber Soul
Good grief.
So we're finally heading to India.
So the man with two right hands is called Centerfold...
By the way, where's Anne?
She was at Singapore Station
I can't help but think that the brat was lying about
Well, it's a bit lonely without her around, isn't it, Jojo?
But talk about creepy...
Apparently, it had already transformed when we left the hotel.
Jojo, are you going to eat that cherry?
I don't mean to be greedy, but they're my favorite.
Could I have it?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...
Hey, look, Jojo. Flamingos in flight.
Good grief.
Jojo...

I'm worried that my body may not be able to handle the culture gap.
That assessment is rather distorted.
You needn't worry. It's a nice country, where simple people live.

Here, have this.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
This is chai.
Chai.
A popular drink in India.
A sweet drink made by boiling black tea, sugar, and ginger with milk.
At last, a little peace.
It's just a matter of getting used to it.
Once you get used to it, you'll see how wonderful this country is.
I like this place. It's pretty great.
Seriously, Jotaro? You really mean that?
Talk about culture shock.
I'll like it once I get used to it, huh?
Well, they say that people adapt to their surroundings.
Where's the john?
It's over there.
Polnareff.
Yeah?
What about your order?
I'll leave it to you.
It had better be something amazing.
Gorgeous, splendid food that suits a Frenchman like me.
Which means we can pick anything.
Let's see, something he'll like...
Excuse me.
Oh, please wait, sir.
Please use this.
What's this stick for?
Hey.
The toilet's shaped oddly, but it's pretty clean.
A nice guy like myself can't stand it when bathrooms are dirty.
Is something wrong?
D-D-D-D-Don't "Is something wrong?" at me!
Th-Th-Th-Th-The toilet...
The toilet...
Oink
There's a pig sticking its head out of the toilet!
This toilet is unusual, even in India.
So when the pig gets hungry, it sticks its head out.
Th-That's not what I'm aski—
Er, wait, what?! That means this pig's food is...
That's why it's there?!
That's why you use this.
Here...
See? Now you can go while the pig's recoiling from the blow to the head.
Our manager actually gets the pig to lick his butt and always says
Please, take your time.
W-Wait! Don't leave me alone!
Gulp.
Menacing
I don't think I could ever get used to this...
I'll wait until we get to the hotel.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Crap.
H-He's gone?
I could have sworn I saw something weird there.
I must have imagined it.
I guess I can't help it.
I mean, there was a pig in the toilet.
It's not surprising I'd see an illusion of a monster outside the window.
So this is what they mean by culture shock in India.
Wha...
What?!
Huh? Huh?
Wh-What is this?!
I can only see it in the mirror!
So this is the mirror Stand that Jotaro heard about.
Th-This isn't good.
This really isn't good!
Silver Chariot!
Wh-What the hell is that?!
Damn it!
Stand!
Where's the user? Who is it?!
The man with two right hands...
There are so many people...
Damn it!
What's wrong, Polnareff?
What's happening?
If that...
If that was the Stand, that means...
That means he's finally here!
Jotaro, the Stand user you heard about that uses mirrors is here!
The bastard that killed my little sister!
The bastard that stepped all over my sister's life, soul, and pride.
I can finally... I can finally see him!
The one you seek vengeance upon is here?
Mr. Joestar, I'll be traveling on my own here.
Wh—
I'll find him first, and kill him!
Even though you don't know what he looks like, or what his Stand is?
Knowing that he has two right hands is plenty!
And he knows that I'm after him, as well.
He should be worried that I'll come for his head in his sleep.
See ya.
You'll go out for wool, only to come home shorn.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just as it sounds.
Are you implying that I'm going to lose?
Indeed.
I will not allow you to travel alone, Polnareff.
Listen up. I'm going to make this clear.
I told you in Hong Kong that I was only traveling with you
Mr. Joestar and Jotaro should already know this.
I've been alone from the start!
I've always been fighting alone!
Such a selfish man!
Did you forget that you were brainwashed by DIO?
Have you forgotten that this all leads back to DIO?
Like you'd ever understand how I feel after having my sister killed!
I heard that the last time you met DIO, you got scared and ran away.
A coward like you would never understand how I feel!
What did you say?
Don't touch me.
You were just lucky that you beat me in Hong Kong.
Why, you...
Oh, did that piss you off?
But don't forget that I'm a lot more pissed off than you are right now!
You can just keep acting like the mature one as always, Avdol.
Why, you—
Mr. Joestar!
That's enough. Let him go.
Now that he's like this, no one can stop him.
No, I'm just disappointed in him.
I didn't think he was that sort of man.
I did indeed run in fear.
What?
Then I'll say this with certainty, too.
Your divination will be wrong.
Tromp Tromp Tromp
Get off.
I'm here to see a friend.
Go back yourself from here.
Please, make me your wife.
I will dedicate my life to you. Just tell me whatever you wish of me.
So please, let me stay by your side forever.
Don't be stupid. You're still only sixteen.
I'm old enough to marry.
I love you.
Listen. I'm just a drifter.
I live each day like it's my last, and one day, it will be my last.
Royalty like yourself can't think about marrying me.
No matter how much we love each other.
Really?
Yeah. You're the only one I love in the whole world.
That's exactly why.
You understand, don't you?
It's hard for me, too. My chest feels like it could burst.
But I'll come see you once in a while and hold you like this.
That's enough to make me happy.
Yes...
Later. Love ya.
It's not nice to eavesdrop.
and that there're girls like her everywhere...
But she's an easy mark, and it's convenient.
She'd do anything for me, even throw away her own life.
You know how I work, don't you?
Menacing
Mr. Centerfold.
By the way, about Silver Chariot's Polnareff.
Seems he's looking for you on his own.
What will you do?
He fell hook, line, and sinker for your plan to lure him out.
Shall we kill him first?
Blam
Let's go.
We can kill 'em all.
Hanged Man
Centerfold
So he didn't come back after all.
What?
You saw him?
You're sure you saw a man with two right hands?
Where?
Huh? That's weird.
What?
He was with that man right there.
Fwoosh
The gun is mightier than the sword.
Man, talk about a memorable quote.
Who the hell are you?
Hol Horse is the name.
I'm the user of the Stand that suggests the Emperor card.
Lord DIO paid me to get rid of you guys.
Hey, country boy. I don't need the self-introduction.
Do you know the man with two right hands?
Well, that was rude. You asked, so I answered.
Well, whatever.
I came here with him.
He's nearby.
What?
Where is he?!
No point in asking that.
I, Hol Horse, will be taking care of you.
and it always ends up the other way around.
Oh? Was that funny?
and that I'd have no problem beating him.
He was exactly right, so I couldn't help but laugh.
If I can't see him until I defeat you, then that's just what I'll do.
Bring it on.
You know Stratego, right?
The tank is stronger than the soldier, and tanks are weak against mines.
See, it's pretty much the basics of battle.
The gun is mightier than the sword.
Seriously, such a memorable quote.
What are you trying to say?
My Stand shoots.
A sword can't beat a weapon that shoots.
So, what? A pea shooter?
I'll kill you!
You underestimated me, Polnareff!
Blam
And now, you've lost!
Fwoom
If it takes off its armor...
It's nothing but a bullet!
What?!
I-Impossible! The trajectory curved!
C-Crap!
The bullet is also my Stand.
Underestimating me by not even considering that
Polnareff!
Wha— Avdol!
I went looking for you because I was worried, and look what I find!
You're too full of yourself, Polnareff.
W-Worried?
Damn you! Are you going to lecture me again?
The enemy knows everything about you!
but from now on, you won't be able to win alone!
What bad timing for an outsider to interfere.
Curve
Move, Polnareff! The bullet's coming back!
Magician's Red!
I'll burn it to cinders!
Damn that Avdol! He went after Polnareff himself.
Where are you, Mr. Avdol? Polnareff?
I have a terrible feeling...
Hey, there's a weird fight going on over there.
The puddle...
What?!
Mr. Avdol!
Man, today must be my day.
so we thought he'd be our most formidable enemy.
Talk about luck!
There are no scary pieces left in this game of Stratego.
Mr. Avdol!
H-He's just hurt...
It's just a minor wound.
See? He's going to start speaking...
He'll open his eyes at any moment.
Right, Mr. Avdol?
You're going to wake up, right?
Mr. Avdol, wake up!
Please! Mr. Avdol!
Impossible. This was too easy.
That's what he gets for lecturing people.
Look at him now.
Wha...
What did you say, Polnareff?
Who asked him for help?!
Guys like him just get in the way...
That's why I said I'd do this myself.
You bastard...
He saved your life. How dare you...
It really annoys me!
Having people up and die on me...
Polnareff...
It just annoys me so much!

He's got a bold face, and yet he died so easily.
Come to think of it, she was really good at sobbing...
Your sister, that is.
Are you telling me to hold back?
Don't fall for the enemy's provocation!
Mr. Avdol told you not to fight by yourself!

He's got such a strong face, and yet he died in an instant.
Well, the end of someone's life is usually a pretty sudden curtain call.
It's probably normal to die without being able to say goodbye.
It may seem like I'm talking as though I know everything, but...
Polnareff! Please, don't let him get to you!
Do you still not understand?
Mr. Avdol told you not to fight by yourself!
And you ignored that...
You wanted to get revenge, even if it meant dying with your enemy.
Mr. Avdol followed you because that worried him, and this is what happened!
So what am I supposed to do?
We need to fall back for now.
Avdol was cruelly stabbed in the back.
My sister was killed without resistance.
You want me to hold these regrets inside and run away?!
Don't fight them when we don't even know how their Stands work yet!
Don't fight a battle that will kill you!
That's what Mr. Avdol was trying to tell you.
Hey! Come on, li'l Pol Pol.
Why, you...
Polnareff! Slowly come back towards me.
We're going to use that truck to get out of here.
Y-You're telling me to hold it in?
A-All ri—
Hey, Polnareff.
Bam

Episode 11: The Emperor and The Hanged Man, Part 2
Avdol died for you.
I think that means you owe him.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
He might not have died, if not for you.
Y-You bastard.
Where's your real body?!
Polnareff, calm down!
But there's no need to be sad. Actually, you should be happy...
Since you'll be together again soon.
You'll die, and then you can be with those two fools in the next world.
Your little sister was really cute, Polnareff...
Once you're reunited with your sister, you should ask her
about exactly how I killed her!
Polnareff, don't let him provoke you!
He you to attack!
Bastard!
Your Chariot cannot cut my Hanged Man.
I am within a mirror.
Your Stand can't enter a mirror. That's why!
You mad?
I bet you're mad.
Hey, Hol Horse. Fire away. Let's put an end to this idiot.
Aye aye, sir.
Die!
Emerald Splash!
What?!
What? He shot...
...Polnareff!
Kakyoin, was it? Not bad.
That's out of my Stand's range.
the bullet wouldn't hit with much force.
Mr. Centerfold went after them, eh?
He must really want to finish off Polnareff.
S-Sorry, Kakyoin.
I-I...
I thought I didn't care if I died, so long as I could avenge my sister.
But I understand now...
I understand how Avdol felt.
I won't let his feelings go to waste.
I'll fight to keep living.
Do you really understand?
Yeah.
Crack
Take this instead of a handshake as proof that we've made up, Polnareff.
Right. Th-Thank you, Kakyoin.
When they come after us again, we'll defeat them together.
Avdol, you...
At that moment, I'm sure that I stabbed him with the sword.
But my strike didn't land.
There was no resistance.
He'll attack my reflection from within the mirror.
My Stand can't go inside a mirror...
How am I supposed to attack him if he's in some kind of mirror world?
Damn it!
Polnareff, you keep talking about
but there is no world inside a mirror.
This isn't some fantasy or fairy tale.
What are you talking about? You saw it, too, didn't you?!
You can only see him in a mirror, and when you turn around, he's not there.
Yes.
But what you see in a mirror is just a reflection created by light.
You don't have to tell me that!
Listen! I'm talking about what's going on right now.
If there are such things as Stands, there could be a mirror world, too!
There isn't.
Look, you...
I think that fact is what will let us solve the mystery of Hanged Man.
then there's still something we don't know about his—
Polnareff! He's inside the plating on the steering wheel!
What?!
He's caught up to us!
Look out!
A-Are you okay, Kakyoin?
I-I hit my chest, but I'm fine.
What?
Chariot!
Slice
Kakyoin! Get away from anything that's reflective!
Damn it... I got it. I just saw it.
He's going from mirror to mirror!
He moves by jumping from one reflective surface to another!
by reflecting over and over!
Reflecting?
That means he's actually light!
The true nature of his Stand is light?
Kakyoin! He was just in the car's bumper!
He's going to reflect off of the car's bumper and into something else.
Don't go near anything that's reflective.
And take anything off your body that reflects!
Take off the buttons on your uniform!
Mister, are you guys okay?
Want me to bring some medicine or something?
Hey! Kid! It's dangerous, so get out of here!
Hey, your car's totally messed up...
Hey, you're bleeding.
What?!
Are you okay?
Th-That asshole!
He's in the kid's eye!
Hey, kid. Don't look at us.
Huh?
I told you not to look at us!
Stop following me with your eyes! Damn it!
Huh? But you're hurt.
I'm fine! See? Perfectly fine!
So go look over there!
But you're bleeding...
Look over there, you brat!
Damn you, Centerfold!
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't stab this cute little kid's eye out
Polnareff!
I finally got you.
You can't run anymore.
What a coward! This is unforgivable!
Hey, Kakyoin.
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.
For my sister's honor, and so that my friend Avdol can rest in peace...
I'm going to hurl you
into the depths of despair, Centerfold!
Forgive me, kid! I'll buy you a caramel later!
There's sand in my eye!
Slice
Bam
P-Polnareff, he's in your eye...
A speed that you wouldn't normally be able to see.
I see...
Hanged Man can only exist within the world of reflections.
So...
As long as I can read his trajectory, he'll be easy to cut with a sword.
His real body is over there!
You bastard. Finally...
Finally!
We finally meet...
Centerfold!
It's a Stand of light that moves at incredible speed.
There's no way I can catch it.
I can slash you, too!
I probably wouldn't have figured that out and you would have killed me.
Polnareff! He's not the man with two right hands!
That's not Centerfold!
Wh-What?!
Polnareff!
Emperor
Hol Horse
Polnareff!
Over here.
Bam
You fool!
I'm Centerfold.
You...
He's just a drifter that happened to be in town.
I just used a knife to give him the same wound I have.
You totally fell for it!
Coming close to him
You bastard!
Take this! My Emerald—
Hey, hold on a sec.
Take a good look around you.
Hey, gather 'round!
These guys say they'll give you money!
What?!
They'll give us money for nothing!
Thank you!
You have such big hearts!
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
Please give us money!
Have you figured out what's going on?
You say you've seen through my Stand?
You fool.
it has no weakness!
Don't look! Don't stare!
You can't run anymore.
What are you going to do? Blow everyone up?
You sacrificed your youth to hunt me down...
And you're going to fail before you finish?! Talk about a lonely, boring life.
Meanwhile I, Centerfold, will continue to have cute girls
Come to think of it, your sister
was really good at sobbing...
You can die now.
Wh-Why, you...
Polnareff, that's not what you say here.
When taking revenge, you shouldn't say, "Why, you..."
You say this.
My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.
I will have you pay with your life.
I'll give this gold coin to whoever picks it up.
It's so shiny, you can see your face in it!
Now I see, Kakyoin.
Looks like all of their eyes are focused on one point now.
Merci, Kakyoin!
The moment!
Rip
Hold it!
It won't open!
Looks like you're the one who's really good at sobbing, Centerfold!
Well, you're about to fall to Hell, sobbing the whole way down.
But there's one thing I can't rely on the guardians of Hell to do for me.
And that's...
To turn you into a pincushion!
I've been waiting years for this moment!
I'll leave the rest to King Yama.
So this is the true Hanged Man...
He was rotten to the core.
I got my revenge.
Hanged Man
Centerfold
Hold it!
I finally caught up with you guys.
Why are you walking so slow?
If you're gonna run, run like your lives depend on it.
Right, Mr. Centerfold?
Better say your prayers. Your lives end here!
So act like this is the end and come at us!
Show us what you've got, damn it!
Right, Mr. Centerfold?
Hey, are you listening, Mr. Centerfold?!
I don't think he's listening anymore.
He's rather busy right now...
Since he's being sentenced in Hell!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't try to pull that nonsense! Bluffing won't work on me!
There's no way you can beat him!
Even I don't stand a chance against the invincible Hanged Man!
Polnareff, your jokes suck.
That piece of shit's body is about two or three thousand meters that way.
Want to take a look?
Okay, I will!
Hey! You're running away?!
I-I don't stand a chance!
I'll run for now and wait for the next opportunity!
I'm the type whose power only shows when I'm paired with someone else.
Being #2 is better than #1!
That's Hol Horse's philosophy of life!
Got a problem with it?!
What?!
Mr. Joestar! Jotaro!
We already know about Avdol.
Though it was a simple funeral, his body's been buried.
but the cause of death was Hol Horse's bullet.
What shall we do with him?
I'll give him his sentence.
Death!
Wha?!
Please run, Sir Hol Horse!
Sir Hol Horse!
What's with this woman?!
but I'm always thinking of you!
That is my reason to live!
Please run! Hurry!
You bitch! Let go of me!
What are you thinking?!
Jotaro! Kakyoin! Don't let Hol Horse get away!
Too late.
Huh? Oh...
Well said, baby!
I'll gladly accept your feelings and keep on living!
I'm running away because I love you, baby!
Forever!
Why, you...
Come back here!
Ah...
Don't "ah" me, you bitch!
Polnareff, that woman was just another one he was using.
And he no longer had any intention of fighting.
We have no time to deal with him.
Avdol is gone.
But we have to hurry ahead.
It's already been fifteen days since we left Japan.
Damn it...
Well, I guess it can't be helped.
All right! Let's resume our trip to Egypt.
Listen up! In order to defeat DIO, our hearts have to be as one.
We can't go off on our own!
That's when he'll come after us.
Got it?
Let's get a move on!
Good grief.

I'm sure they did something underhanded.

Listen up.
I don't usually lecture.
Stupid people are stupid because they don't understand something
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
You know guys like that, right?
But you know, uh...
I never got your name...
Nena.
Nena! That's a great name.
You're the daughter of
You're good-looking, and I can see that you're a smart girl.
I have an eye for people, so I'm going to lecture you.
Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard.
You're being tricked! Your parents would cry.
Listen up.
You can't end up like this.
It's easy to do that when you're in love...
But you can't look at things this way.
It's important to look broadly, and be rational.
Hey. It's coming into view.
The city of Varanasi.
The holy river, the Ganges.
This river gently embraces all these things as it flows.
Everything from birth to death is laid bare in this river.
It is said that people can spend months
That is probably because the scenery one sees in this city
reflects the scenery of one's soul.
Chomp
Man... it's getting worse.
What's wrong, old man? You don't look well.
Looks like the spot that I thought was a bug bite got infected.
It's definitely swollen.
It would be best to have a doctor look at it before it gets worse.
Hey, doesn't that sort of look like a person's face?
Stop kidding around, Polnareff.
Sorry 'bout that.
No! Stop treating me like an old man.
Let's cut this off.
Huh? What'd you say?!
It's definitely infected.
If we don't cut it off and get the poison out, it'll get worse.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry. We'll numb the area, so it won't hurt.
No problem. No problem at all.
Come now, lie down.
I studied medicine in England.
Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.
All right.
What the hell?
No problem.
Hey, are you done?
Is it over yet?
Shriek
Shriek
What?!
Hey, Doctor!
Trying to cut me? You're pretty stupid, you moron!
Wh-What the hell is this?!
I'm the Empress, as in the Empress card, Old Man Joseph!
And now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!
When did you get on me, damn it?!
Clang
It has teeth! It stopped the scalpel!
It's so strong!
It grabbed the scalpel!
Slice
Oh, no!
Th-Thank goodness it was my artificial hand.
You bastard! You're gonna cut yourself?
I'm part of your body, Old Man Joseph.
You can't get away from me now, honey.
Now, why don't I guess what you're thinking?
This is what you're thinking...
Stands can only be beaten by other Stands.
the ability to see things far away.
Nope! Not possible!
Where's the user?
You fool! Like I'd tell you!
Damn you!
Are you going to your friends?
I wonder if it'll go that smoothly.
Doctor, your next patient is waiting...
Th-The doctor...!
H-Hey! Don't get the wrong idea!
I didn't—
I am the culprit!
I am Joseph Joestar! An American!
I'm staying at Hotel Clarks!
What?!
By the way, girlie.
I have a thing for hot young nurses like yourself.
What?!
Murderer!
Wait! It's not true!
Oh, no...
Now you can't go back to the hotel.
Now I can kill you without anyone getting in the way!
Y-You little bitch!
I'll crush you to bits!
What?
Hey, this is arm.
Take care of it, you shitty old man.
It grew arms. I-Is it continuing to grow?
H-Hey! Let go!
Nope!
Officer! The culprit's over here!
He's right here!
It's been a while since it came to this...
Hey! What are you doing?
Overdrive!
You moron!
This is your arm!
You, right there! Don't move!
In that case, Hermit Purple!
I-It's squeezing me...
I can use Hermit Purple this way, too!
I told you not to move!
You! Stop right there!
Damn it!
What are you doing? It's dark in here!
What is happening?
Hermit Purple
Joseph Joestar
So really, Nena...
Real men don't talk big.
That's how you figure out who's a liar.
how about me? Am I not your type?
I don't dwell on the past.
I don't care who you were dating in the past.
What's important is the future.
If our feelings understand each other.
Oh, look over there.
That place is a hotel run by a Japanese woman named Kumiko.
She manages it with her Indian husband.
Out of the way.
We can probably get a room very cheap.
Oh, really?
Now, what about this hotel?
Wha...
What are you doing?
I'm eating, Joestar.
To get bigger.
You stole those at the market! You quick little bastard.
Plop
Why, you...
Wham
Now I'm this big!
You ugly bitch!
I said that, but what the hell am I going to do?
Anyway, Hermit Purple!
Father, thank you for raising me.
But you shouldn't tie your children down like this.
You need to raise your children to be free.
Chomp
Oh, no!
I-It's no use.
but I don't have a camera!
Wh-What should I do?
I've now grown enough that I can kill you.
See? My hand can reach your neck.
If I bust the carotid artery in your neck, you're done for.
Oh, no!
You bastard!
What the hell is that?
Look!
Damn it! Where's the Stand user?
Polnareff, sir...
I'm a woman who can't survive without a reliable man.
I love you... Because you're very reliable and kind.
H-Hey, where did all that come from?
I-Is this for real?
Lucky!
Hey, Joseph Joestar.
You idiot.
Do you think I'm running around randomly just to wear myself out?
I'm running so I can kill you!
It was so...
I could dunk you in this!
Blop
Stick
You senile old man!
A nail?!
I picked it up earlier.
I picked it up when we were rolling around on the ground earlier.
So I can cut open your carotid artery!
Did you think I'd suffocate if you stuck me in here?
Die!
I have a physical form, but I'm not a living organism.
Did you already forget that?
Only Stands can defeat Stands.
Hey, didn't you say you were going to show
Where's that "experience" you were talking about?
You're just a helpless geezer who's gotten too old!
M-My artificial fingers...
and now I can't get any strength in them...
Just one more push, now.
Your life as an invalid is about to come to an end.
There's not a single way you can defeat m—
Huh?
Not a single way...
What?
Sorry, my hearing isn't what it used to be.
Run that by me one more time.
Coal tar!
You stuck me into coal tar!
It wasn't to suffocate me, but to solidify me!
B-But...
With the power of my Stand, Hermit Purple.
H-Hey, everyone look...
What is this?
The ashes that foreigner spilled everywhere...
They've formed into a map of the city.
Y-You used spirit photography!
That's how you found the coal tar.
You used the ashes to make a spirit photo!
Now I think you should be able to see the difference in our fighting experience.
Once your opponent starts to boast his victory, he has already lost.
This is how Joseph Joestar does things.
I guess I just get better with age.
And...
A Stand can tear away another Stand.
You're going to say, "Stop, anything but that."
Stop! Stop, anything but that!
Bam
This isn't good. It pains me, too.
Children can't depend on their parents forever.
You've got to go out on your own once you've grown big!
Now then... where's this Stand user?
W-Well, then, Nena...
Let's swear our love with a kiss.
What? What? What the hell?!
Wh-What's wrong, Nena?!
Burst
Gyaah
So that's The Empress's Stand user...
Huh?
Huh?!
This ugly woman...
and camouflaged herself as a beautiful woman.
That was pretty careless...
She totally played you, Polnareff.
U-Ugh...
Empress
Nena
And here I thought we'd finally be able to sleep in a bed.
Maybe if the old man hadn't screwed up and gotten cops chasing him down.
I took care of things.
We can take this car.
Polnareff, you can do the driving.
Hey, are you still in shock?
I was the one attacked by the Stand.
I'd rather have gone through that...

Stop driving so slow! You're in the way!
I'm gonna pass them.
Polnareff, you're being reckless!
This four-wheel drive is great!
Hey, do you think that might've flung pebbles at their car?
Who knows? It could have.
We don't need any trouble or accidents right now.
I'd like to get across the border safely.
What's the matter, Polnareff?
I just told you we don't need accidents!
N-No, look! Look who's standing over there!
Good grief...
Hey! Looks like we meet again.
Give me a lift?

I'd look pathetic wandering around the world when I'm that age.
This is the only chance I have! Right now!
Don't you think so?
but let's just forget that.
It's the car we passed earlier.
They appear to be in a hurry.
Let them pass.
Yeah...
Hey, now!
What are they trying to do?
I let you pass, so hurry up and go.
Maybe they're mad because you were so reckless earlier.
Did you see the driver's face?
So you couldn't, either...
It couldn't be...
Be careful, Polnareff.
Now he's telling me to pass!
Looks like he remembered how shitty his car is.
You should have just stayed behind me in the first place, dumbass.
What?!
A truck? That's impossible!
It's no use! We're going to crash!
Star Platinum!
Th-That was close!
If it weren't for Star Platinum's power, we would have been crushed.
Where is it?! Where's that car?
Looks like it took off.
Do you think that car's driver might be one of the Stand users that are after us?
Or do you think it's just some random asshole?
Of course it's someone who's after us!
But there hasn't been anything like a Stand attack yet.
Anyway, all we can do is be careful as we head for the border.
Yeah.
What should we do about that truck?
Just pretend you never saw it. Ignore it.
So cool... I'm gonna go crazy...
A roadside tea house...
Let's take a break.
If we take our time, we may avoid running into that car.
What's that?
Sugarcane juice.
Wanna try some?
All right, then...
What?!
I-It's him!
Hey, I need to ask you something.
Where's the driver of that car parked over there?
I-I'm not sure. I didn't notice when it parked there...
I doubt that the driver will just come out and announce himself.
He's messing with us!
This leaves us with only one option. Right, Jotaro?
Yeah...
We'll just beat them all down!
H-Hey, Jotaro, stop!
Mr. Joestar, you too?! This is going too far!
A face like yours looks the most suspicious...
C-Come on!
D-Did we just get played?
Did anyone see his face?
N-No. What is he trying to do?
It's going to piss me off
Not to mention
Damn it! For a piece of shit car, it goes pretty fast.
we should be running parallel with train tracks here.
Who the hell cares?
That bastard!
Impossible! It's a dead end!
He's gone! Where did he go?!
He disappeared after the curve?
And a car couldn't cross that suspension bridge...
What?!
I-It's him!
How did he get behind us?
H-He's pushing us with immense horsepower...
What the hell is this? A tank?!
It's no use! Everyone, abandon the car and get out!
Polnareff!
What kind of driver gets out of the car before everyone else?!
Who's going to hold down the brake pedal?
Huh?
S-S-Sorry!
Hierophant Green!
Fwoom
Stop!
It'll just tear its body apart!
I am not a fool.
It flew up holding the car's wire winch!
Hmph. Not bad, Kakyoin.
By the way, do you like sumo?
Especially deadlocks at the edge of the ring...
It's exciting, isn't it?
Ow...
But Jotaro, in sumo, it's against the rules to punch your opponent.
Star Platinum
Jotaro Kujo
Yeah. Either way, he can't possibly survive.
Well, I guess he got what he deserved.
But I wonder why...
That car was suddenly behind us.
It's so strange.
It's not strange at all...
It's the radio!
It was able to do that because it's a Stand, Joestar!
What?!
If it knows my name, it must be one
Where is it coming from?
That's impossible! That thing is totaled!
No, there's a possibility the whole car is a Stand.
Just like the Stand for Strength was a boat.
The Wheel of Fortune...
The Wheel of Fortune?!
What is that tremor?
This isn't good...
Everyone, get in the car!
No, don't!
Everyone get away from the car!
It can't be...
The ground!
Crash
Impossible! It burrowed up through the ground!
I think it's pretty obvious that car is actually a Stand!
It appears that the Stand's user is inside.
What the hell?!
What is that thing?
It's like a living creature!
It transformed! It's going to attack!
Zoom
Hmph.
Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight yet!
Not until we know what that Stand's power is!
Jotaro!
I-Impossible... I couldn't see it.
What did it shoot at me, and how?
You couldn't see it?
You'll soon find out...
When you're about to die, that is!
Jotaro!
Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!
What the hell is this?!
I can't see it at all.
Are you all right, Jotaro?
Don't worry about me. Anyway...
but it's got good control.
Run between the boulders!
Stop running away!
What?!
What the hell are you guys? Cockroaches?!
Oh, no! It's forcing its way in!
We're no match for it.
Head further back!
N-No one's carrying me!
Yeah, I ran away from home.
I'll just die!
Good grief.
I love you, Jotaro!
Climb if you want.
There are literally no roads left for you!
Because...
This
Wheel of Fortune is going to grind you into hamburger
Oh, no!
I-It's climbing up...
Is there anything this car can't do?!
Good grief.
Looks like we're going to have to face it.
Everyone, stay back.
Once it climbs up here, we'll see the car's underside.
That's when we'll find out who's stronger.
You're quite energetic, Jotaro!
But not smart at all!
Come to think of it, I smell gasoline.
It's our bodies!
It was shooting gasoline at us!
It was shooting small amounts of gasoline at high speed, like bullets.
I-Impossible...
Looks like you finally caught on, but it's too late now!
What?!
Jotaro!
Jotaro!
Don't go near him, Mr. Joestar!
There's gasoline on our bodies, as well.
Jotaro!
I win! Part Three is over!
Oh? And who exactly is going to replace me, Jotaro Kujo?
You didn't think it'd be you, did you?
You burrowed into the ground with Star Platinum!
So the only thing that burned up was your jacket!
Hmph. By the way, weren't you saying something about roads earlier?
You were wrong.
And so, I, Jotaro Kujo, will show you how it's done.
I'll show you exactly how roads are built!
I-I'm being crushed...
Jotaro!
That's how it's done.
Where you went flying, there is now literally a road.
Good, good.
What an odd character.
Talk about a bluff.
Hey! Don't you run away!
Don't kill me! I'm just in this for the money!
Oh, God.
To think that the Stand was disguising such a small car, too.
It looks like a sheep that's just been shorn.
How pathetic.
I am a priest in training. Please do not disturb my ascetic exercises by undoing my restraints.
It's pretty beat-up. I wonder if it'll last that long.
Help! Help!
By the way, you're going back to Hong Kong on an airplane.
Aw, why?!
Shut up! Don't you get that you're in the way?
We might not make it...
Help!
Wheel of Fortune
Zii Zii
All of the seven Stand users I sent have been defeated.
All of them have been crushed!
I cannot bear to face Lord DIO.
Curses! That hateful Polnareff! Kakyoin!
As well as Jotaro and that geezer Joestar!
I, Enyaba, will now face you personally!
With my own Stand, the Justice card!

The fog is getting worse from over there.
They died with that look of fear on their face!
Why is that?
What is with everyone in this town?
This isn't an ordinary murder.
Joestar and company.
You seem to be travelers.
Assalamu alaikum.
Episode 14
Justice Part 1
Jonathan won his battle.
But he lost everything to do so.
I brought him here three days ago.
He's totally alone.
I hope I can give him the will to live!
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 4: Overdrive
Spirit! What Jonathan needs now is spirit!
It's the middle of the night, but his room is lit.
What's going on?
That woman!
Her hands are cracked from being wet so long.
She must have cooled his burns thousands of times!
I'm glad.
He's conscious!
You're through the worst of it. You'll be fine.
You've been treating me?
You...
How could you be here?
You look like...
No, never mind.
It couldn't be.
You really look like her.
Who do I look like?
Erina Pendleton?
It's nice to see you, Jonathan Joestar.
JoJo...
Erina, you've really grown!
Me? You've grown a lot more!
But...
It really is nice to see you again.
Yeah.
I wasn't cut out for that sort of work, anyway.
I'll come back later.
Time for Speedwagon to play it cool.
I-I must have fainted.
Oh, dear!
But your arm is broken!
I'll always hold you.
Some people are just fated to meet each other.
-Whitechapel, London-
You're out playing too late, you harlot!
Most humans are bound by the laws of good.
They fear the power of evil.
But a rare few are born unfettered by good...
...the evil elite.
I can use you, Jack the Ripper.
Submit your will to me.
I'll give you wondrous power and unprecedented pleasure.
You need worry no more.
Only Speedwagon and I know about the tragedy here.
The police think it was an accident.
But where is the mask?
I didn't find it in the rubble.
I hope it was smashed.
I think it was. I want to forget all this.
JoJo!
Erina...
Who is he?
He's been following us.
Is something wrong?
No, everything's fi--
Mister Jonathan Joestar.
And the lady is Miss Erina Pendleton.
W-Who are you?!
You did well to survive against the mask's power!
JoJo!
That's right. Squeeze every bit of air out of your lungs.
JoJo!
He's injured! How could you?!
He's out of breath, but there's no need to worry.
W-What on Earth?!
What's happening?
I feel so...
M-My arm!
I am Baron Zeppeli.
Courage alone won't defeat the mask.
But my arm was shattered!
The pain is mostly gone.
I can even lift this rock!
That's incredible!
W-What did you do to me?! Who are you?!
One question at a time, please, JoJo.
I did nothing. Your breathing killed the pain.
Why did you do that to me?
How do you know my na--
H-He's gone.
I said one question at a time, JoJo.
I'll show you the answer.
Follow me.
What you will see will change your destiny.
I struck your diaphragm with a finger and altered your breathing.
How did you alter it?
Allow me to demonstrate its energy.
What does he plan to do?
What's happening?
L-Look at the water!
Those ripples are unnatural!
This is the same energy that removed your pain.
Don't!
T-The frog wasn't hurt!
That was Sendo.
S-Sendo?
Hamon, or ripple energy, creates Sendo.
My Hamon energy went through the frog's body and split the rock.
JoJo, I know for a fact the mask is still intact.
Dio, the mask's master, holds it!
What?!
Did you just say Dio?!
I did! 
I intend to destroy the mask and vanquish its owner!
You are destined to fight against the mask.
You must master Sendo or face certain death!
And humanity will fall with you!
T-This is...
JoJo, what's going on?
What does he want?
Erina...
I can't let her get involved in this.
Anyone but her...
A-Astounding!
The blossoms!
U-Unbelievable!
The Hamon energy left from healing his arm revived the blossoms!
This JoJo may be an untapped wellspring of strength and talent.
This youth may be the one who can save the world!
My power is slowly returning.
The food chain...
Pigs feed on grass. Humans feed on pigs.
And we feed on humans.
Humans are our food, so we are the true masters.
Bon appetit, Jack.
I'll start with a few wicked servants.
Next, the world!
It will all belong to me.
Humanity will kneel at my feet!
-One week later-
I studied Hamon under the tutelage
I knew I had to defeat Dio.
And this is why.
JoJo, let me tell you why I am hunting the mask.
It started when I was a young Will A. Zeppeli.
At the time I had a limitless thirst for the unknown.
I traveled the world as part of my father's archaeological team.
One day, we were excavating an Aztec site...
You mean...
That's right. It was my misfortune to unearth that cursed mask.
On the voyage home, one of our team donned the mask and chaos ensued.
He tore off the heads of his companions in a bloodthirsty rampage.
The entire crew of 58 was killed.
I dove into the sea to escape, but he followed me!
Suddenly, dawn broke!
In the light of the rising sun, I saw his face.
It was the expedition leader...
...my father.
The ship drifted away with the mask still aboard.
I was filled with dread
I knew I had to find a way to stop it.
That path led me to the ways of Hamon.
Hamon energy comes from the flow of one's own blood.
The mask drains energy from the blood of others.
They are two sides of the same coin, the same energy!
I see! It's like using fire to fight fire!
Correct. Strike them with enough Hamon energy, and they will explode.
And the waves created by Hamon...
...are the same as waves of sunlight!
Baron Zeppeli, please teach me how to use Hamon.
I'll do anything to learn it!
I'll teach you, like it or not.
You will be Dio's first target in his conquest of the world, JoJo.
Listen, JoJo. Breathing affects your blood.
Your blood carries oxygen you inhale.
The oxygen in your blood affects your body's cells.
Your cells are your body.
Like ripples in the water, breathing properly creates Hamon in your body.
And that creates energy!
His arm suddenly extended!
How did he do that?!
It's called a Zoom Punch.
I dislocated my shoulder and extended my arm!
JoJo, do not break the rhythm of your breathing.
Hamon energy is sensitive to emotional disturbances.
Yes, sir!
Hey!
Jonathan!
Speedwagon!
We're headed for Wind Knights Lot?
That's right. I confirmed that someone like Dio is there.
Many have gone missing there recently.
We have no time. JoJo, your final test will be combat.
Yes, sir. I'm ready to do battle.
Same here!
Here's the entrance to Wind Knights Lot!
We'll attack while the sun is still up.
I left without saying goodbye to Erina.
I will return to her!
What the...?
Driver, why have we stopped?!
Careful, there's no sun in here!
Hey, driver!
Is it Dio?
Where did he go?
Both of you, step away from the horses.
What in blazes?! He was hiding inside the horse!
Jonathan, this guy... This guy is bad news!
He's crueler and crazier than Dio!
So Dio's already gathered evil minions!
Stand aside, you two.
I'll do the fighting.
He's a zombie.
They feed on the living to gain eternal life.
But they are mere puppets that must obey their masters.
I'll let you enjoy the most exquisite terror!
Once the blood has drained from your faces, I'll drink every drop!
Wriggle in despair, little worms!
Now, what's his next move?
If I were him...
JoJo, this method of thinking is key.
First you must consider the situation from the enemy's viewpoint.
If I were him, I'd cut off the route to the sun by blocking the entrance!
He's collapsed the tunnel's mouth!
Jump, Speedwagon!
Here he comes!
H-He's covered in knives!
S-So that's how he shish-kebabbed the driver.
Hamon Cutter!
My Hamon Cutter is far sharper than your knives.
JoJo, here's your next lesson.
Think of a flea.
A miniscule insect, right?
Despite their size, they see fit to challenge towering humans.
Should that be called courage?
I don't believe so.
So what is courage?
Courage must know fear and make fear its own!
Fear upsets breathing!
Conquer fear and your breath will never fail you!
Hamon breathing comes from courage!
A good human is a brave human!
Courage is a marvel of humanity!
Though powerful, zombies do not know courage!
They are just like fleas!
Sendo Wave Kick!
My Hamon energy has disrupted the zombie's body.
He didn't even spill his wine!
JoJo, you will finish him off.
Destroy his entire brain. That's the only way to kill the undead.
Time for the slaughter, you naughty little pigs!
I'll dice you to bits and eat you!
You're really going after him?!
It has to be done.
But JoJo will do it alone.
JoJo.
You must destroy him without spilling a single drop.
One last lesson, JoJo.
In the land of Norway, they say the north wind created the Vikings.
Spill a drop and even if you destroy that zombie...
...I will abandon you.
Listen to yourself! Have you gone insane?!
You stay out of this!
I'll do it.
The north wind created the Vikings.
It's a labyrinth.
It was made to create confusing shadows even when lit.
O-Oh, no! The fire!
The light will only make me a target!
But now I have no clue where he'll come from.
How fragrant! The smell of fresh blood.
First I have to think like the enemy.
He must be close.
Next, I have to make fear my own.
I will control my breath.
Come! I'll chomp down on your carotid and pull it out with my teeth!
The harsh wind from the Arctic Ocean gave birth to the mighty Vikings.
In other words, challenges can create opportunities.
Will that wine create a Viking?
If not, then Dio has already won.
These ripples! It's Hamon!
So my north wind is this wine!
The wine senses Hamon.
It goes through the glass, my arm, my body, the ground...
I can feel his vibrations!
The wine is a Hamon detector!
My spirit trembles!
I'm burning up!
I've found you, zombie!
Pierce this wall!
Sendo Hamon Overdrive!
Come here so I can suck your blood!
Sounds like JoJo figured it out.
The north wind has made a new Viking!
Next episode
We meet at last.
I lay my curse upon you!
Can he overcome this delusion?
A duel between heroes!
Dio, I'm ending your madness!

My, that looks so good on you!
but I've never gotten such a strange request for clothes.
I'm in a hurry. What's the total?
See ya.
Th-Thank you...
Let go! Let go of me!
Don't touch me in weird places!
Shut up! Don't say it like that!
Here's the ticket.
No! I don't wanna!
I want to go with you guys!
Little Miss.
My daughter, who is Jotaro's mother... Her life is in danger right now.
We're going on this journey to save my daughter's life.
Give up on running away and go back home.
I'm sure your parents are worried.
There.
Fine. I'll make you look good this time, Grandpa.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
See ya! Life is just a bunch of goodbyes!
But I did sort of want to see again before I had to go.
Bye-bye, Jojo! You better save your mom, no matter what!
I'll be cheering you on!

Pakistan
India
Pakistan is a young country, established in 1947
following its separation from India.
there was already civilization in Pakistan.
Here in Pakistan, the people carry on the five thousand year
history of the Indian subcontinent.
Episode 14: Justice Part 1
But, Jotaro, I'm surprised you were able to get someone to make you
a Japanese school uniform here in Pakistan.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
The fit is perfect, too.
It's 100% wool.
Polnareff, is it safe to drive right now?
It appears the fog in this area is getting quite thick.
Yeah. It might be a bit dangerous.
Since there's a sheer drop to one side, and no guard rail.
Indeed. The fog gets thicker up ahead.
It's not even 3:00 yet, but I guess we have no choice.
Let's find a place to stay in that town for the night.
I wonder if there's a nice hotel.
A nice hotel?
One that has a decent toilet, of course!
I still can't get used to the toilets in India and West Asia
where you wash yourself with your hands.
Was that a dog's corpse?
What's the matter, Jotaro?
No, it's nothing.
This is a nice little town.
I'd say it has a population of a few thousand.
Let's ask about a hotel at that restaurant there.
But it sure is a weirdly quiet town...
Every other place has been super crowded and noisy.
It's probably because of the fog.
Listen up, everyone.
this is how you greet people.
First, you smile and say...
Assalamu alaikum!
E-Er... You didn't have to close up shop so suddenly...
We just wanted to ask a question. Is there a hotel nearby?
Silence
Hello?
I don't know.
Huh?
Hey, wait a minute. What do you mean, you don't know?
Wh-What's with that guy...?
I must have imagined it.
I'm sure he couldn't understand you because your pronunciation's so bad.
Let's ask the guy sitting there.
Hey, guy! Sorry, but we're looking for a hotel.
Preferably a hotel with nice, clean toilets.
Do you know any...
Hey! You!
What's wrong?
What?!
They're dead! They died with that look of fear on their faces!
Wh-What the hell is this? Why are they lying dead in the road?
What was the cause of death?!
A heart attack? A stroke?
That could be... But it doesn't seem to be ordinary heart failure.
A g-gun! This guy is holding a gun...
You just noticed?
There's smoke coming from it. He's fired it.
And it was just fired. Maybe two to five minutes ago.
Either way, it was right before we got to this town.
Was it suicide? Did he shoot himself?
and there's no blood anywhere.
Then how'd this guy die? Look at him!
His face is distorted like he was screaming in utter terror!
I don't know.
What did this man shoot with his gun? What in the world is going on?
No one in the town noticed anything?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Someone has died here. Please call the police.
Pardon. My acne seems to have festered.
By the way, did you need something?
I said I'd like you to call the police.
The police?
For what?
Look! There's a dead body over there!
Oh, my. There's a dead body?
Is there anything I can do?
I already asked you to call the police!
Right, right. Call the police...
All right.
My acne has festered and it's so itchy. Terribly itchy...
What is with the people in this town?
let alone a whole curious crowd.
Did they not even hear the gunshot?
These people are even more indifferent
than people in large cities like New York or Tokyo.
That dog...
It feels like the fog just keeps getting thicker.
The town seems to be engulfed by this fog.
It's really creepy.
Doesn't that part there look like a skull?
What do you want to do, old man?
You don't think it's the work of another Stand user, do you?
It seems impossible.
There's no motive.
Would someone who's after us kill a man
who has nothing to do with us, before we even got here?
If they did, why did they kill him?
But there is a possibility. His death seems pretty extraordinary.
Let's investigate the body
as much as we can without touching it, before the police come.
Right...
It appears he was traveling, too, just like us.
He has bus and train tickets.
And he appears to be Indian. He's carrying Indian money.
He's not from this town.
Oh?!
A wound!
Right under his throat, there's a wound about the size of a 10 yen coin.
Is this the cause of death?
But why isn't there any blood coming from it?
With a hole this big, there should be
tons of blood gushing from it.
Normally, at least.
Looks like this is no ordinary murder.
We need to know. Let's not hold back.
Take off his clothes.
Bam
Wh-What's with this corpse?
There are holes all over it!
He looks like the cartoon cheese you'd see in !
And there's no blood coming from any of these holes.
How on earth was this man killed? What does this all mean?!
Be careful.
The odds that there's a new Stand user nearby just grew.
Everyone!
Get in the car! We're leaving this town!
What?!
That's impossible!
This isn't the car!
Hermit Purple!
Hey. Old man.
What the hell are you doing? Are you stupid?
Oh, no!
What do you mean, what am I doing?! The car was right here a minute ago!
What? Car?
We just parked the car over there.
What?!
B-But just now...
You seem to be travelers.
With this fog, it's dangerous to leave the town now.
There are many cliffs, you know.
I run a little bed and breakfast.
If you'd like, why not stay there for the night?
I'll make it cheap.
We finally met a normal person!
Hermit Purple
Joseph Joestar
There's a strong possibility that
a Stand user is hiding somewhere in this town.
This thick fog also gives them the upper hand.
We cannot let our guard down at all tonight.
But... even without anyone attacking us, this is a really creepy town.
Come now, Mr. Joestar. That is my hotel.
I shall lead the way. Please come with me.
and John Lennon from the Beatles even stayed here once.
What? Really?!
No, not at all.
Wha?!
But it is still quite a nice hotel.
There are currently no other guests.
Would meat for dinner be all right?
Or would you prefer fish?
Hold it, old lady.
You just said "Joestar," didn't you?
How'd you know that name?
Come now, sir. That person there just said "Mr. Joestar" a moment ago.
What? Me?
Well, I guess I might have.
You did, sir.
you learn to memorize people's names quickly.
So I'm sure of it.
By the way, Ma'am, what happened to your left hand?
Oh, this? I just burned it a little...
but I accidentally spilled boiling water on it.
Age? What are you talking about?
You only look to be about forty.
Maybe I'll ask you on a date.
Please don't tease me so, sir.
What the hell are you saying, you fool?!
I hate you most of all, Polnareff!
I'll make sure you suffer a thousand times what my son did
when I cut your dick off and rip out your guts to kill you!
Oh, this doesn't look too bad.
Here, Kakyoin.
Right.
My autograph's worth as much as Lennon's.
Here.
Yeah.
I'm nareff, after all!
Make sure you take care of it.
My, my...
I will do just that.
To commemorate your death!
It's done.
Well, then... I will show you to your rooms.
Man... Talk about a weird town.
All right, I'm going to the bathroom.
It appears to be broken.
Then I won't be able to use Hermit Purple to
get information on the enemy...
Hey, Mr. Joestar.
What's the matter?
Is there a bathroom in this room?
There doesn't seem to be one in mine.
Maybe the bathroom here is communal.
Oh, right!
Good grief. He's so carefree.
An unknown Stand user could attack at any moment...
So, the Joestar party is on the third floor?
Hol Horse... So, you've come.
Yeah. I just now tracked them as far as this town.
But you surprised me, Enyaba.
I didn't think you'd come here yourself.
Wh-What's wrong, Enyaba? You just started crying out of nowhere.
I-I am happy, Hol Horse!
Thank you for coming!
Thank you for coming to see this lonely old woman!
I am very happy to see you!
Hol Horse, you were my son's friend, were you not?
Friend?
Huh? Wha...
A-Ahem...
Yes, I certainly was.
Sob, sob. Were you close?
Close?
Yes! He was a dear friend.
We were an excellent team.
What's wrong? This isn't like you.
Will you avenge my son? Is that why you've come?
Yes! That's exactly it!
I'm going to avenge my best friend!
That's why I'm so happy!
Swoop
Stab
Because I can kill you!
E-Enyaba?! Wh-What are you doing?!
How dare you abandon my son to save yourself, Hol Horse?
I was determined to kill you as soon as I saw you again.
My son's best friend? How dare you?!
W-Wait! You've got it all wrong!
When I got there, Centerfold was already dead!
Unforgivable! You are as unforgivable as Polnareff!
I'll have you die by the hands of my Stand, Justice!
J-Justice?
I'm sure you've heard of it, but haven't seen it yet...
I shall show you now, Hol Horse!
Th-The blood from my arm where the scissors stabbed it...
It's going up into the fog...
Splort
A fine hole has appeared!
That's right. My Stand, Justice, is a Stand made of fog.
Any wound touched by this fog becomes a fine hole like this.
And then...
Justice wants to dance!
The fog has entered the hole in your arm, like a string!
And now, you are my puppet!
Die by your own hand, Hol Horse!
Smash
Damn it! Don't get so cocky!
Emperor!
Die, you shitty old hag!
Justice will triumph!
What was that noise?
That room at the back of the lobby is really loud...
Is something wrong, Polnareff?
I thought I heard a strange noise.
I'm going to take a look downstairs.
I'll be in the lobby, so call me if you need me.
Curse you, Polnareff!

I just saw him. He's in the bathroom.
Oh, the bathroom?
The bathroom is just past that door.
I thought I just heard someone say "toilet."
I always seem to get attacked in bathrooms...

Episode 15: Justice Part 2
Polnareff... I want to kill you!
I want to avenge my son by ripping out your insides!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Hey, old lady!
But I can't let him find Hol Horse's corpse right now.
She's not behind the counter, either.
It'll be even worse if the other three show up.
I need to kill them one by one, damn it.
Go away for now!
Old lady, are you here?
I thought I heard some kind of crash.
I'm coming in, old lady.
Whoa!
Ouch...
What happened, old lady?
Oh, it's nothing.
I just fell and banged my hip.
You fell?
You sure are careless.
Thank you for your concern. I'm sorry... I'll be fine.
No problem at all.
Get out!
I'll spare you my wrath for now...
But later on, I'll kill you just like I killed Hol Horse!
I just need to give you a little wound...
And I can make you a puppet for my Justice to control!
There we go... Here's your staff.
What? You seem to be sweating a lot.
No, really, don't worry about me.
Please just go rest in your room.
Are you sure?
But, are you running this hotel all by yourself?
Don't you have any other family?
Huh? What was that?
E-Er, I was just saying I've gotten used to living alone.
I see...
But isn't it lonely?
Like, say your son had a wife.
Your grandkids could run around happily in the lobby.
It'd be a little noisy, but...
Aren't families great?
If you had kids, would they be older than me?
What's wrong?
N-No. They've passed away.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been totally rude, then...
You're the asshole that killed him, god damn it!
I'm going to kill you! Kill you!
Here, have a seat.
Want me to rub your shoulders?
I'm alone, too.
I lost my mother when I was really young.
This makes me think of my mom...
and ask anything you want of me.
You stupid little brat!
Wow, you're really tense.
I guess it's really been tough on you.
Wh-Who is that?
H-Hol Horse? You're still alive?
You must have made your Stand disappear as soon as it
Th-That face!
Menacing
P-Polnareff! Behind you...
You're Hol Horse!
Wha—
What are you doing?!
Shut up! I'm the mother of Centerfold, whom you killed!
Chariot!
Why, you... You're a Stand user?!
All those responsible for my son's murder will die!
M-Mr. Joestar!
It's too late.
Because...
I've summoned them.
Who the hell are you guys?!
Y-You're...
The Indian traveler we found dead
as soon as we got to town...
These corpses are moving?!
This is my Stand, Justice's ability!
No one can have more than one Stand, but Justice is a fog Stand
that can control corpses!
It can control hundreds, even thousands!
Aren't you taking this unjustified grudge a bit far?
To think that such a twisted Stand user was after us...
The whole town's trying to kill you.
A-And if you get wounded, this will happen...
I just need to give you a little scratch.
Just a little one.
Then my Stand, Justice, will kill you!
Get him!
I'm outta here!
Polnareff! Don't leave me here!
Oh, shut up! Did you forget about Avdol?
I have no obligation to help you!
I'm not letting you get away, Polnareff!
I'll yank your brain out!
I'll break your spine in half!
I'll crush you to death!
I will get vengeance for my son!
How terrifying!
Can an old woman really run this fast?!
Take this!
Damn it! He ran into the back room!
After him! Break down that door!
Wh-What the hell...
This is a hallway leading down to the basement.
I'm so far away now, they'd never hear me!
I don't think I'd lose if I fought on my own, but...
If I get even a scratch on me, I'll be in trouble.
She'll open a hole in me, and control me.
D-Damn it... Isn't there a way outside?
I can't get out the windows since there are bars on them.
Damn it...
I'll hide in this room.
That's the sound of the door breaking...
A-At this rate, I'm going to have to fight.
But I can't let them land even one scratch on me.
I hear them walking down the hallway.
They must be checking the other doors.
Damn it, they're getting closer and closer to here.
Not to mention... What the hell?
Now that I look at it, is this room a bathroom?
I always seem to get attacked in bathrooms...
Damn it, the toilet is so dirty...
All right, come at me.
But the second you walk in, my Chariot will chop up four of you in a single breath.
Wh-What?
Now I don't hear anything.
Those things... That old hag...
What the hell are they doing?
Aren't they going to break down the door?
What the hell are they doing?
React in some way, damn it!
Squirm
They were looking in from the other side!
What the hell?!
Sh-Shit...
He stabbed me in the tongue!
Well done! You've finally fallen under my Justice's control!
You shitty little brat!
Laugh!
How very pitiful, Polnareff.
Very pitiful, indeed!
Polnareff?
Lick the toilet until it's clean.
Lick it all up!
Lick it all up...
A-Anything but that...
Anything but that!
Help...
Wh-What is it?
You just walked in without knocking...
What do you need?
I'm looking for Polnareff.
And I did knock.
Maybe you didn't hear me because you
old lady.
Justice
Enyaba
Menacing
I'm looking for Polnareff. Have you seen him?
What should I do?
The moment I act dumb, he'll think that I'm suspicious.
So troublesome.
I'll stab him with these scissors!
After that, my Stand will beat him to death.
Yes, of course.
I know exactly where Mr. Polnareff is, Mr. Jotaro.
Oh?
Crap... Jotaro doesn't know
that even the smallest scratch will spell his doom.
D-Don't come here! Go tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin!
That old lady is the Stand user!
He was just here. He's in the bathroom now, Mr. Jotaro.
Oh, he's in the bathroom? Is it inside this door here?
Yes, that's right.
You fool! You are a child, after all!
If I kill Polnareff, it'll make my son in heaven happy!
If I kill Jotaro, it'll make Lord DIO in Egypt happy!
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to ask, old lady...
Oh? What's wrong, old lady? You just fell down.
Did you trip on something?
Th-That was too close...
Oh, yeah, that's really dangerous.
Falling while holding scissors...
Thank goodness.
Sorry to ask before you even get up, but I have more questions for you.
Why did you just call me Jotaro?
That's what I want to know.
Well, answer me.
but when something bothers me, I can't even sleep at night.
Wh-Why do you suspect me?
The hotel register!
You wrote your name on the hotel register earlier!
It's so dry in here.
You wrote "Jotaro Kujo."
Oh?
You mean this thing?
Yes, that exact thing!
"Qtaro Kujo"?
"Jotaro" isn't written anywhere.
I suspected you from the moment you called me "Joestar" when we first met.
I told the others not to use my name.
And yet, you knew my name... Which means...
It's no use playing stupid.
I already know you're one of the Stand users that's after us, old hag.
Menacing
Well, what's wrong?
Aren't you going to show me your Stand?
I've already shown it to you!
My Stand, Justice, will win!
I just need one spot! One little spot!
You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro!
Polnareff!
Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse!
Enyaba's Stand is a fog Stand.
She can even control corpses!
Shut your mouth, Hol Horse!
Can you punch fog with your fist?
Can you shoot fog with your gun?
Futile! Absolutely futile!
You guys can't do anything!
Th-That's the ultimate Stand!
Our little Stands don't stand a chance.
There's nothing that can defeat that Stand.
Yes, yes, keep them coming.
Say more things like that.
Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro!
R-Run, Jotaro! You'll get a hole in your leg!
Good grief.
There's no reason to run.
I'll defeat that Stand.
Oh? What was that?
Before I do what one more time? You stupid little brat!
Before I take another breath?
Just once...
What...?
Jotaro's Star Platinum has begun inhaling Justice's face...
P-Please stop...
...and he's holding it in!
Whoosh
At this rate, she won't be able to breathe!
It looks like her head is full of
I'm so angry...!
Why does it even matter what I've been licking?
You ask such stupid things.
Cough, cough, the toilet, cough...
Eh? You were licking what, again?
I couldn't hear that very well.
Who cares what it was?
I want to disinfect my tongue.
Just give me the medicine already.
Hm? I thought I just heard "toilet"...
Actually, I already know.
Hey! Did Jotaro already tell you?!
You shitty old man!
Forget about the medicine!
All right, all right. My bad.
I'll fix you right up, Polnareff.
If you don't take care of that, it'll get infected.
Ahem! Toilet. Ahem...
You licked a toilet...
Damn it! Let's hurry back on our journey! Jotaro! Kakyoin!
Everyone, come outside.
What on earth?
We step outside of the hotel, and this place is...
It's a graveyard.
She was using her Stand's fog
to make this graveyard look like a town, and a hotel?
So we were talking to the corpses
that were buried in these graves...
Star Platinum
Jotaro Kujo
T-Take her with us? The old lady?
Yeah.
where in Egypt DIO is hiding...
And what DIO's Stand's power is.
If we're able to get the old lady
it'll give us a definite advantage.
I doubt that she'd be willing to tell us, though...
We just need to use my Hermit Purple
to project what she's thinking onto a TV.
Oh, right!
we'll do it in the next town.
Hol Horse!
That bastard!
Our car!
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with DIO after all.
See ya later!
Provided you guys don't die first, that is.
But I'll give you a warning!
You should kill that old lady as quick as you can.
Otherwise, that old lady'll show you
just how terrifying DIO really is.
See ya!
What the hell is he talking about?

Why are you here in front of me?
Lord DIO will never...
They should be able to become smaller.
When I say I'm going to do something...
He just went flying like the other guy!
Oh, God!
You don't need power to kill humans...

Hey, a doner kebab place!
Why don't we stop and get something to eat?
Doner kebabs are the hamburgers of the Middle East!
A slab of meat is placed on a spit, and its surface roasts as it turns.
They then shave off the cooked meat
Excuse me. I'd like five of those.
Five will cost you a thousand yen.
A thousand yen?
In the Middle East, the logic of Japan and
Namely, prices are very unspecific.
have no idea what things cost and are easily exploited.
But in this world, such exploitation is not seen as a bad thing.
The one who was tricked into buying is seen as an idiot.
I will now explain how to buy things!
A thousand yen?
In this situation, for instance, act like you see through the trick...
Don't mock me, now! That's far too much.
...and laugh out loud. And then...
How much would you buy them for?
...they will ask the customer how much they're willing to pay.
Make it 250 yen for five!
They'll take the attitude, "Seriously? Have you no sense?"
If I sold them for that much, my whole family would starve to death!
Then they will gesture as if their head were being cut off.
But you mustn't give up yet.
Then maybe I'll just buy them somewhere else.
Act like you're leaving...
Okay, friend! I'm very kind to foreigners.
I'll sell you five for 700 yen.
...and they'll say that to try and stop you.
Make it 300.
Let the haggling begin!
600!
350!
550!
400!
450!
425!
I'll take them!
All right! I got them for less than half his original price!
Take that! I made out like a bandit!
And just as you think that...
I usually sell five for 150 yen!
Bye-bye, thank you!
Hey! That old lady's awake.
Eh?
I-I... I haven't said anything!
Wh-Why are you here before me?
would actually tell them the secret of Lord DIO's Stand?
Huh?
Menacing
Wh-What the hell are these tentacles?!
Why...
Why have you come to kill me?!
It means that Lord DIO truly trusts no one.
I will be making sure you never speak again.
And as for you four there...
I will be taking your lives.
Old lady!
What?!
My name is Dan...
Dan of Steel.
My Stand suggests The Lovers card.
I will see to it that you all meet the same fate as Enyaba.
How could you?!
Old lady!
L-L-Lies... Lies...
It's a lie...
The thing coming out of the old lady's body is not a Stand!
They're real! They're real, moving tentacles!
He would never do something like this to me...
He would never plant a flesh bud...
Flesh bud?!
Lord DIO is my reason to live... We trust each other...
Old lady!
Th-They...
They melted from the rays of the sun.
The flesh bud! It's DIO's own cells!
Precisely! I'm impressed you were able to figure that out.
I just grew it inside of Enyaba.
Enyaba, I hear that you were the one
But there is no way that Lord DIO
It seems you hadn't realized that.
Old lady!
Tell us!
And now you know he's not the man you thought he was!
I have to defeat DIO! Please, tell me!
Tell me! Tell me about DIO's Stand!
Lord... DIO...
He believes in me.
I can't tell you...
Oh, God!
How sad...
How truly sad that old woman was.
But the fact that she trusted him so deeply
shows how powerful Lord DIO's evil charm truly is.
But I will kill you.
It'll be four against one, but we won't hesitate.
Stand up.
Hey, jackass!
Even if you won't attack us, we're going to fight.
Do as you please.
Smash
What?!
Wh-What happened, Mr. Joestar?
He flew back just like that guy!
You fool! I was still in the middle of my explanation.
You were very close to killing your own grandfather.
Listen carefully.
Y-You bastard...
Wh-What is that?!
The battle has already begun, Mr. Joestar.
You fools...
No matter how hard you look, you won't be able to find my Stand easily.
Hey, brat.
I'll give you a tip, so hit my leg with your broom.
I-It can't be...
Hit me!
What happened, Mr. Joestar?!
I-It hurts!
I don't know what's going on, but there's tremendous pain...
You haven't figured it out, Joseph Joestar?
My Stand goes inside the bodies of others.
The moment Enyaba died, it entered your brain through your ear.
What?
Meaning, the Stand and myself are one and the same.
If my Stand gets hurt, so do I, and vice versa.
my Stand, which is within your brain, will react to my pain and suffering
It will inflict pain several times greater to the same part of your body.
I'll say it once more...
You will not be able to lay a single finger on me!
Not to mention, The Lovers has taken Lord DIO's flesh bud into your body.
It's growing within your brain.
Just like Enyaba, it will eat you from the inside and you will die!
Ow!
When did I say you could strike me again?
You little brat!
Well, to be honest, my Stand, The Lovers, is very weak.
It isn't powerful enough to move even a single strand of hair...
But...
You don't need power to kill humans.
Do you understand, gentlemen?
The Lovers
Dan of Steel
Your body would suffer far greater damage than mine.
I-I can even feel real pain in my artificial left hand...
Jotaro, calm down! Don't do anything stupid.
No. I'm going to kill him so quickly, he won't have a moment to feel pain.
Without a moment to feel pain, huh...
That's a great idea.
Let's see you try it, Jotaro.
It sounds fascinating.
Come on! My face? My throat?
Come on, what's wrong? Just try it!
How about busting a hole through my chest?
Here, I'll even get the rock for you.
Is this one big enough?
You don't want to underestimate me.
Don't do anything rash, Jotaro!
You've already seen his powers!
H-He's the type that might actually do it...
You aren't taking me seriously.
Oh...?
You...
Jotaro!
Don't underestimate me, you bastard.
After the geezer Joestar dies, next it'll be...
Look out!
...your brain that I send The Lovers into and kill!
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!
H-How can this be?
We're completely caught up in his pace.
His Stand is inside my brain...
When I was younger, there was a time when poison was placed into my heart, but...
I must do something... I must do something!
H-Hey!
Jotaro! Keep him away from Mr. Joestar!
Oh, I see...
But one's weakness can also be one's strength.
Hey, Jotaro! I'm talking to you!
What are you looking away so calmly for?
You sound like you're starting to lose your cool.
Do you plan to follow me until Joseph dies?
Dan, was it?
Is this all you have?
I see that your watch, audaciously enough, is a TAG Heuer...
There!
It's an electronics store! Mr. Joestar, they have TVs!
H-Hey! What are you trying to do?
Polnareff, did you think we were just running away?
I'm going to fight the Stand that's inside my head.
F-Fight?!
We only have a few minutes. You'll be assisting us.
Huh?!
Hermit Purple!
There it is!
Oh, no!
How can it be that I had to see inside my own brain?
I-I can see now that there's a really tiny Stand
But how do you plan on defeating it?
Your Stand and mine will enter Mr. Joestar's body, and defeat it there.
Wh-What?!
Stands are images made of energy.
Kakyoin!
Hey, take it easy on me.
There's no time to lose. We're going in, Polnareff!
A-All right!
Hierophant Green!
Silver Chariot!
Smaller!
Get smaller.
We're going to be entering a blood vessel.
R-Right...
A drainage ditch...
but if I were to trip and twist my ankle, it could be dangerous.
It'd be a pain to go all the way to that bridge over there.
Hey, Jotaro.
What? You're not going to be my bridge?
What the hell are you talking about?
I said, make yourself into a bridge! You ridiculous bastard!
Wh-What's wrong?!
Mr. Joestar!
M-My leg...
I-It's going numb...
What the hell is Jotaro doing?!
What's the matter, Jotaro?
Come on, hurry up.
Good.
You're a rather sturdy bridge, aren't you?
Aren't you?
Aren't you?
Aren't you...
Polnareff, open a hole in the wall of the blood vessel.
H-Hey, hold on a second! You're using your Stands, right?
At this size, it's not possible.
The hole will be microscopic, so there's no need to worry.
Cutting through a blood vessel or nerve right now
Otherwise, our Stands would have already cut down the enemy Stand.
Though we may have already started...
Keeping our Stands this small is really exhausting.
Here we go!
Oh, my God! I-I don't feel so well...
Next Episode Preview
My back itches...
I'm in a really good mood right now.
How about I have you lick it for me?
The one who knows himself best will win!

you acknowledge your own weakness!

Episode 17: The Lovers, Part 2
You made a nice bridge, Jotaro.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Hey, Jotaro. My back itches.
Scratch it!
A little lower.
Lower...
Yeah, that's it.
Mr. Joestar?
Hey, what's wrong?
I-It feels like someone's tickling my back...
I can't concentrate on my Stand like this!
Mr. Joestar!
Wh-When did all of these people show up?
Mr. Joestar, keep your voice down!
People are staring!
I-I'm not yelling for the fun of it!
Oh, no!
Poor man...
Let's give him some change.
What is this?
It's not easy having an older relative like that.
You said it.
Kakyoin, go buy the TV.
R-Right.
Are you the owner?
Eh? Yes...
I'd like that TV.
I can't believe Kakyoin's Hierophant and Polnareff's Chariot
have shrunk themselves and entered Joestar's body.
They're trying to fight me?
I can see it!
I can see where they'll exit
Over here!
We only have minutes left before the flesh bud
Hurry, you two!
There we go.
All right!
Now, Mr. Joestar!
Hermit Purple!
Th-This is...
These tentacles are part the flesh bud!
It's him!
L-Look!
All right! I'll cut them apart!
No, not cut... I'll grate them!
Like a daikon radish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
You bastard!
Now's our chance!
Slash
We did it!
N-No, that wasn't enough!
That thing's pretty fast, Kakyoin.
But I've already seen through his moves.
If that's the best he can move, he's no match for...
Polnareff!
H-Huh?
Polnareff, that's not me.
And what you cut wasn't the Stand.
Wh-What?!
I'm The Lovers!
Polnareff!
It was disguised!
Mr. Joestar's brain cells!
He was using the mash of kneaded brain cells
And what you defeated was merely a dummy made of brain cells!
You were completely fooled, you idiots!
Come on!
What are you doing?
Shine those shoes right, Jotaro!
I'm in such a good mood right now!
I need you to shine my shoes until they're as bright as I feel right now.
If you want, you can use your uniform to shine them.
Actually, why not lick them clean?
Hey! You bastard!
What are you writing?!
Punched in the gut Hit with a rock Stole my wallet Stole my watch Walked on, like a bridge, over a dirty river
I'm writing down everything you owe me.
Made me scratch his back Made me shine his shoes Kicked me
I can be forgetful, so I'm writing it all down.
Jotaro, you bastard...
Well, whatever. It won't matter in the end.
Whoa! Kakyoin, look!
Look at that dummy's head! The one I just cut open!
Wh-What in the world...
He's splitting into two!
Listen up.
The same goes for me.
I know that I lack the power or speed necessary
once you've acknowledged your own weaknesses!
Emerald Splash!
Did it work?
M-More dummies made out of brain cells...
They're multiplying!
B-But a person can only have one Stand. Only one is real!
Wh-Where's the real one?!
Right here!
Emerald Splash!
So close! I was right next to that one.
The more we hit the wrong ones, the more it multiplies!
No, no...
It's me...
It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!
It's me, after all!
Polnareff, that's enough!
Withdraw your Stand.
Damn it!
Withdraw your Stand! You're going to get killed!
Not to mention...
There's no more time...
Don't give up until the very end, Mr. Joestar!
I can't tell!
Which one is the real one?
Which one is it?!
The weakest of all is also
most, most terrifying of all!
Say, Jotaro. Take a look at this gold bracelet.
if you were to give her something like this.
see that space in the glass?
Use your Stand to sneak through and steal it!
I told you to steal it, you dumbass!
Hurry it up!
I don't mind breaking the glass and taking it myself.
Are you okay with them catching me and beating the shit out of me?
Joseph would definitely die from the pain.
Hurry up!
This guy's shoplifting!
You bastard...
The Lovers
Dan of Steel
This guy's shoplifting!
Hey, salesman!
Sir! Please don't let him get away!
Sure!
You bastard...
What? A thief?
Who is it?
That guy?
That Asian kid?
Hey, Jotaro.
Bastard!
Take this!
Despicable!
You thief!
Get out of our country, asshole!
We'll let you go at that. You can keep your fingers!
That was great! Well done!
Jotaro!
I'm laughing in anticipation of the fun that's to come.
I'm laughing because I have much more to look forward to now, and I'm excited!
I'm so excited for the moment when I get to pay you back.
Why, you...!
You seem to misunderstand.
Old Man Joestar will die within seconds.
Nah. You don't know us very well.
You don't know Kakyoin.
What?!
"Everything begins once you've acknowledged your own weaknesses," eh?
I see...
To know yourself is an important lesson...
But you clearly don't know your enemies well enough.
You haven't done your research.
Didn't you realize?
so I can inspect every single one of you!
Something's suddenly touching me!
You're the Stand!
Emerald Splash!
Bang
We did it!
Well, well, well, well...
That injury means that Kakyoin's on the attack now.
I wonder if I'll still have my chance at payback once he's done.
He's realized he's out of his league! He's trying to escape into the artery!
He's trying to escape!
He's trying to get out of Mr. Joestar's brain!
Huh? He's leaving?
All right! That's great!
Mr. Joestar, hurry! The flesh bud!
Right!
Over Drive!
The flesh bud is disappearing!
I-I'm saved...
Now we can be more dy with Mr. Joestar.
Polnareff, you know...
Oh! B-But wait...
that means the Stand...
...is going back to its user, Dan of Steel!
That's not good! Jotaro doesn't know that!
What's wrong? Why are you stepping back?
You're not going to tell me about what's happening to my grandfather?
Hey, hey, hey...
Where are you trying to go?
You aren't trying to run away, are you?
Not after all this...
Please forgive me, Jotaro, sir!
I admit defeat!
You can hit me as much as you'd like! Hit me! Kick me!
But please, spare my life!
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...
Soon...
The Lovers will soon be back!
This idiot, Jotaro, doesn't have a clue!
This time I'll invade your brain from your ear!
Kakyoin's several hundred meters away. Just you wait!
I'll give you pain that will make you wish you were dead!
I-It's here!
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!
Now! Go in!
I figured you were planning something like this.
Are you sure you did your research on us?
I-I-I'm not planning anything!
Your Stand's power...
"Your" Stand? Just "your"?
N-No! I-I meant Stand is more powerful
I didn't stand a chance, so it came back!
P-Please look!
Well...
As for what you owe me...
Do you swear that you'll never appear before us again?
I-I do! I swear!
You're not lying, are you?
I'm not lying! I'd never lie!
Get out of here.
Let's play soccer over there!
But then I can't play!
Jotaro!
You fool!
Take a look at that girl over there!
My Stand, The Lovers, just went into that girl's ear.
He's heading for her brain.
Don't you dare move, Jotaro!
I'm going to stab you in the back with this knife!
I'll make sure you never move again!
Just try to attack me with your Star Platinum!
That girl will surely die!
You would never kill such a young child, would you?
Good grief. Fine, try it.
Hey! Don't you understand?! I told you not to—
Huh? Huh?!
What's the matter?
Like this?
M-My body won't move! Why?!
Wh-What's this thing wrapped around me?!
So you didn't notice?
You must be totally oblivious if you didn't realize that
Please forgive me!
Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba, the woman you killed.
We never had any intention of forgiving you in the first place.
D-DIO paid me in advance... I-I'll give you that.
Good grief.
You can't pay back what you owe
with money.
Here's your receipt.

Are you sure you're not just being paranoid?

I really can't shake the feeling that someone's staring at us.

Here, right?

I might even buy them a car.
My, what a talker.
How about we get dinner sometime?
Polnareff, I'm terribly sorry to interrupt when you're so busy, but...
Mr. Joestar!
We're leaving.
Come on! Don't mess with the hair.
Who cares about your hairdo?
We need you to drive.
Righto.
Bye, Mademoiselle.
Why not get an off-road vehicle?
You'll find out soon enough.
But, man, I can't believe this country.
Indeed.
All the houses around here would
Apparently, this is the norm for the people here.
this place grew into a dream-like city.
No complaints here.
Oh?
What's wrong, Kakyoin?
I-It's nothing.
but I feel like someone's watching us, so I can't help looking back.
Yeah, I can't blame you.
I've been thinking about our route from here.
About 100 kilometers northwest is a village called Yarpline.
Because of the desert and mountains, the road is heavily curved.
Up to now, I've been worried that attacks by Stand users
I don't really want to board a Cessna with a man
On camels, it would take one day.
Camels?!
Leave it to me.
Just sit back and relax.
You want camels?
Sure, but they're pretty expensive
and not easy to care for.
so we need them, whatever it takes.
As for payment, how about a trade for that car?
What?!
That's way too much, sir.
Yeah, Mr. Joestar!
Why else do you think I bought such a fancy, expensive car?
An off-road vehicle is better in the desert.
In a place like this, trading is far more effective.
Well, it just means we've suffered a lot already.
Hey, Mister.
Huh?
This seals the deal, right?
In a desert, that's the most important thing.
Water is cheap compared to that car.
You sure are an odd one.
All right, everyone. Let's get ready.
Crossing a desert is a tough task.
Let's keep our wits about us!
I-It stinks!
Hey, Mr. Joestar.
It's, like, three meters tall.
Well, you see, with camels...
You make them sit first, and then get on.
You make them sit first, and then get on...
You make them sit, then get on!
J-Just one moment. It's gonna sit down right now.
Hey! Sit! Sit down!
Damn it, you stubborn animal!
Hey, you ridden one of these before, right?
I've seen that really long movie, , three times!
Though, two of those times, I slept through half of it...
M-Movie?!
What? You've never actually ridden one?
It's great sunscreen! Didn't you know that?
Listen up...
When dealing with animals, it's important to understand how they feel.
Here, doesn't this apple look delicious?
Come on, come on...
Good boy...
Look! See?! It sat down!
I did it!
It's so high up!
They can close their nostrils to keep sand out.
Just don't make any stupid jokes
All right. Now I'll tell you what to be careful with when riding camels.
Listen up.
So just ride with that rhythm.
Like this!
Hey, wait! T-Too fast!
L-Listen to me...
Not that way, I said!
All right. Looks like everyone got on as smoothly as planned.
Let's get through that desert, everyone!
Onward toward the northwest!
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Something's wrong.
I still can't shake the feeling that someone's watching us.
Kakyoin, I think you're worrying a bit too much.
The palm leaves are covering our tracks.
And we can see a great distance around us.
If someone were here, we'd know.
Actually, I can't help but feel a presence, too.
Jotaro, look into it.
Do you see anything suspicious?
No, I don't. There's nothing. But...
Something's weird. Something is...
Hey, let's hurry up and go.
Indeed.
and once the sun goes down, we'll stop and put up our tents.
It's too dangerous to travel at night.
But, man, it's hot. Look, it's 50 degrees Celsius.
It is hot.
Eight o'clock? Wha?
Jotaro! What time does your clock say?
Ten after eight...
Hey, Old Man!
So, it is...
b-but what's going on?
It's past 8 PM...
So why isn't the sun going down?
I-Impossible!
N-Not only is it not going down...
...but it's actually rising higher and higher in the west!
Could that sun be...
...a Stand?!
The Sun
Arabia Fats
I-I can't believe this!
Try to hide behind some rocks!
That sun is a Stand?!
We were careless. I didn't realize...
I felt like we were being watched, but couldn't see it at all...
At this rate, all day long... No, all night long...
That Stand is planning
and kill us!
No. It won't take that long.
How can we fight it?
Damn it! It's now 70 degrees Celsius!
Not to mention, we can't even tell if that Stand is close or far away!
The distance is impossible to judge!
The quickest way to settle this is to take out the user.
Yes, the user... Whoever it is should be nearby.
We must find them.
Hold it!
That's inconceivable.
but I'm sure you can feel The Sun's energy...
The user must be nearby.
This isn't good...
But just staying still won't help us!
I'll use Hierophant to look around.
Kakyoin!
I'll just find out the enemy Stand's location.
Twenty meters. Forty meters...
Sixty meters. Eighty meters...
One hundred...
Something's not right!
Kakyoin! Call Hierophant back!
Something's coming at us!
Before that happens, Emerald...
Kakyoin!
The camel!
You bastard!
I'm busting a hole in the ground, so get in!
Are you all right, Kakyoin?
Yes. I was in the middle of using Emerald Splash.
B-But more importantly, it's hot...
That attack was perfectly aimed.
Where are they?! Where's the enemy?
Don't talk so loud.
Calm down. Let's just sit tight and see what happens.
Oh, shit!
Things can't go on like this...
Think!
But we're in a bad spot.
I can't even use my best technique.
I have to get some information...
Jotaro!
Son of a bitch!
How are you watching us?
Hey, Kakyoin, what's wrong?
Hey, Kakyoin!
What are you laughing about?
Get a grip, man!
J-Jotaro? You, too?!
Y-You, too, Polnareff?!
Oh, my God!
I'm the only one left who's sane.
Hey! Jotaro, calm down! Get a hold of yourself!
The best way to win when the going gets rough is to stay calm!
Wha?!
Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Joestar...
Look at that rock over there.
Isn't it just big enough for someone to hide behind?
What do you mean?
Now look at the rock on the opposite side.
On the opposite side?
You still don't see it?
There's a rock that's shaped exactly the same
The shadow is also reversed. Which means...
It's so stupid!
Move.
A hole appeared in the air?!
Good grief. You're pathetic, Old Man.
I'll just assume that the heat's too much for you.
Otherwise, it's hard to believe you're my grandfather.
We've defeated the enemy Stand, so it's night now.
Or should I say it's back to being night?
Either way, we're safe.
How long do you plan to stay in that hole?
R-Right...
Good grief. It's finally dark.
It's a mirror!
Take a look.
Check out the machines behind this mirror.
Man, I didn't realize that he was reflecting the desert
He has a tank of water.
Hey, a drink.
Huh?
Wait, this means... we beat him already?
That would be what it means.
The Sun
The Sun Retires
The Sun card's Stand, huh?
Let's hurry to our next destination.
It's quite chilly in the desert at night, isn't it?
W-Wait! Traveling at night is dangerous!
Ba-dum-tss.

So noisy...
What is this place?
It's an amusement park!
I've never been here before.
Wh-What am I doing lounging around on a ferris wheel?
Something's wrong.
I'm sure we were traveling through the Saudi Arabian desert by camel...
But everyone's gone.
Am I by myself?
Still, something's strange.
but I keep hearing a baby crying.
I wonder where it is...
Menacing
Th-This card is...
Death 13!
The card is moving!
Kakyoin! Kakyoin!
Come on, give me a break!
Stop freaking out and shaking the bed like you're in .
You scared me to death.
Where are we?
Don't ask dumb questions.
Come on, get up already.
Once we eat, we're flying outta here.
Today looks like another hot one.
I had a terrifying dream.
It was truly terrifying.
Ooh, what did you dream about?
Let's hear it!
Well, I can't remember. I've forgotten it all.
What?
Anyway, it was terrifying.
You saved me when you woke me up.
Man, don't say weird stuff like that.
We're leaving. Hurry up and get ready.
My hand is cut.

Episode 19: Death 13, Part 1
Jotaro and Mr. Joestar have already headed to the plane.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
We're gonna travel 500 kilometers today.
My dog!
My dog... is dead!
Who would do such a thing?!
A dog...?
A dog...
I could have sworn I saw a dead dog not long ago...
It's awful, but it has nothing to do with us.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold on a sec, Mister.
Whaddya mean you can't sell us the plane now?
You said last night you'd sell it, and even took my money.
I'll return your money.
You see, the baby's sick. It's a 39°C fever.
Huh?
There's no doctor in this town, so we have to take the baby somewhere else.
Th-Then how about the plane over there?
That one's broken.
The others are out and won't be back any time soon.
What's up? Some kind of argument?
Yeah.
A baby...
A baby, a baby...
I seem to recall hearing a baby cry...
But I can't remember where...
The plane will be back tomorrow night.
I can sell it to you after that.
Tomorrow night?
Someone's life is on the line for us, too.
We can't afford to spend two days lollygagging.
Then are you going to let that baby die?
Well...
Um, how about this?
who can visit the doctor on their way.
Uh, but that's...
The Cessna only carries four.
But there's room enough for a baby.
I could swear I just saw it smile...
And it already has teeth...?
You sure, lady? You wanna leave the baby with these guys?
H-Hold it. That's also a problem!
It's dangerous for a baby to come with us.
I said this would be dangerous...
Don't worry, Mr. Joestar.
No one would send their Stand after us in the air...
We even made sure the plane itself wasn't a Stand.
I'm more worried about the Old Man's flying than enemy Stands.
Oh, thank goodness. What a relief.
By the way... I wonder whose baby that was.
You're not its mother?
I found it by the well this morning.
and made me think it needed to be on that plane.
Wha...
I always get so tired when I get on a plane...
Sorry, Mr. Joestar, but I'm gonna nap for about 30 minutes.
Sure.
The hell is this?!
K-Kakyoin, what is this place?!
Where's Mr. Joestar? And Jotaro?!
Bam
The dream I had this morning is continuing.
We're inside the dream!
What? A dream?
Yes.
Oh! So this is just a dream.
What a relief. A dead dog isn't scary if it's just a dream.
Polnareff, what are you saying?
Dreams are only scary because you think they're scary.
Come on, relax.
You're wrong! How could we both have the same dream?!
but that could happen in a dream.
Whoa! How did this happen?
This is both convenient and lucky!
See? If you think they're fun, dreams become fun.
Listen! You saw this dog's corpse this morning, didn't you?
This dog must have had the same dream I did.
It was killed in the dream!
That's also when my hand was cut.
By who?
The enemy's Stand, Death 13!
The enemy's Stand?
Yes.
Oh, you had a dream about Stands?
Come on, relax already.
No! It wasn't a dream about Stands.
A Stand was in my dream!
Right. So this is a dream, yeah?
You're so dense!
Lali-ho! Talk about a big idiot!
For pity's sake...
I'm saying that you're slow, Polnareff!
I-It's coming from the dog's wound...
Lali-ho! You're in the Death God's world of dreams, Polnareff!
A megaphone...?
Wh-What the hell is that?
Polnareff, get ready to battle! That's Death 13!
W-Wor—
Come forth, Hierophant Green!
Come out, Hierophant!
Chario—
Hierophant isn't coming out! I can't summon him!
Chariot isn't coming out!
Is it because we're inside a dream...?
Lali-ho! Don't you think it's romantic, being able to die in a dream?
Lali-ho!
Death 13
J-Jotaro, do you feel that?
Yeah. I feel it.
Are you stupid?
You know that only a Stand can defeat a Stand, don't you?
It's time for your eternal sleep, Polnareff.
Lali-ho...
Polnareff!
Die!
Polnareff.
Wake up, Polnareff.
Polnareff, the baby's wet himself.
Change his diaper.
Curses! Someone must have woken him up.
He's quite lucky.
Lali-ho. Well, that's fine.
As soon as he wakes up, his memory of this is gone.
I'll just have to get him when he falls asleep again.
Then, Kakyoin, I guess you're first.
Lali-ho!
Hey, are you awake, Polnareff?
The diaper! Change the diaper!
All right...
I feel like I had a terrifying dream...
But I don't remember what happened in it. I've forgotten...
you can go finish that dream.
I won't wake you up again.
H-Hold on a second!
This kid's crapped his diaper!
Look! Just look at this!
Well, he's a baby. That's why he's wears diapers.
Seriously?! You're serious about this?!
I had no idea! What a vile creature...
Man, it's all over the place...
Stop yapping and change it already.
It stinks.
Aren't you embarrassed? Hurry up and become an adult.
Does this work?
Well, I say it's good. Jotaro, hold on to the edge there.
I'm going to pin it.
Right. Like this?
Hey, hold on to the baby.
Lali-ho!
Stop! Stop it!
What's the matter, Kakyoin?
Hey!
What's going on?
Stop! Stop! Stop it!
Crap!
I can't control it!
Hey, are we going to crash?
Stop!
Kakyoin, what the hell is wrong?
He was like that this morning, too!
Whatever, just calm him down.
Old man, hurry up and regain control!
We're going to crash!
Hey, Kakyoin, calm down.
We're about to crash because of you.
Lali-ho.
Talk about a rough sleeper. You're gonna kill my user at this rate.
Y-Your user is that baby?
I-I can't believe it...
He's only about six months old...
Eleven months. Eleven months!
I'm a genius. A genius!
I may crap in my diapers, but I know a lot more than you guys.
Lali-ho!
Now you won't be able to scream anymore.
A Stand within a dream...
I have to let Mr. Joestar and Jotaro know of this somehow...
What are you doing?
Hurry up and level us out.
Stop fussing! I'm a man who doesn't know panic.
I'm working on that right now!
I'm not waking up...
Lali-ho. Looks like no one's going to notice if you're cutting your arm
with a knife that's smaller than my wee-wee.
Besides, you can hurt yourself all you want in a dream, but it won't wake you up.
As long as you're asleep, I control your mental energy.
Death 13 is a Stand that enters the unguarded mental state of sleep.
Damn it. Stop!
What's wrong, old man?
We're crashing!
I'll control it with Hermit Purple!
I did it!
I got control back just in time!
A close one...
Looks like we managed to avoid crashing.
Those guys are dangerous.
Now then... how about I kill you by crushing that heart of yours?
Then Joestar and the others will just think that you had a heart attack.
Die! Kakyoin!
Did you all see that?! How do you like my flying now, huh?!
Hey.
Smash
Wh-Why is there a palm tree out here?!
Good grief... So...
This is actually happening?
Abu Dhabi
Crash
Cairo
Crash
Crash Site
Is this enough?
Yeah, thanks.
We survived, but...
Kakyoin, what's going on?
This is all your fault.
I don't know...
I feel like I might have had a terrifying dream.
When I woke up, I was dead tired.
Is there something wrong with me?
Cheer up. I'm sure you're just too tired.
and the enemy's been attacking nonstop ever since.
Hey. Looks like the baby's fever's gone down.
Thank goodness he's safe.
If we lost him, I don't know what we'd do.
Peek-a-boo!
Peek-a-boo!
Such a cute smile!
What's so funny about that? It's not even a joke or anything.
What an idiot.
Shut it. I'm getting tired of humoring this guy, too.
Hey, Old Man. The radio's not busted.
What should we do? Should we send out an SOS?
That'll mean DIO can find us, but...
It can't be helped. Let's call for rescue.
We'll do it for the baby.
I thought something hurt... There's blood again.
Did I cut it when we crashed?
Bam
What? The cuts form letters.
Baby... Stand?
That's what it says...
Wh-What does that mean? It's my handwriting.
I can't remember...
Did I do this to myself?
but it seems it was done with this blade.
Did I forget something really important?
Damn it. I heard they were clever...
But he actually carved letters
into his arm while cutting himself...
What was that look in the baby's eyes?
And as soon as our eyes met, he consciously looked away.
Baby...
Stand...?
Baby... Stand.
Did something really happen to my mind?
I'm starting to think...
that this baby is really a Stand user!
Hey, Kakyoin! What are you doing?
Come on, that's too rough.
You could strangle him doing that. What's wrong with you?
M-My apologies...
There, there, it's all right.
Let's get something to eat.
I'm sure you'll calm down once you eat.
Hey, Jotaro. It looks like Kakyoin's really losing it.
There, there, everything's okay.
I wonder if he's gonna make it through this trip.
Next Episode Preview
What do you think about Kakyoin?
Did you see that?!
Kakyoin, that's enough. Stop that.
How foolish are you?
He's a Stand user!
Did you cut that into your arm yourself?
Do they misunderstand even more?
Lali-ho!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
approximately 8,800 kilometers from Japan.
It's been around four weeks since we left.
If we don't hurry, there'll be serious trouble.
Kakyoin...
Hey, Jotaro.
What do you think is up with Kakyoin?
He was flailing around in his sleep on the plane, and now he looks like this.
He even went after the baby.
Something's wrong with him. I think he's at his wit's end.
I don't know if he can continue this journey.
I panicked back there, thinking Kakyoin had figured out who I am...
But now, Kakyoin's half-doubting himself.
And we're in the middle of the desert.
Now, I just have to wait until they're all asleep.
If there's no one to wake them up...
That smells great. What are you making?
Baby food.
This is milk, egg yolks, bananas, and bread all stewed together.
Here. Want a taste?
It's good!
I could totally go for this! Give me more! More!
Hey, now. There won't be any left for the baby.
You bastard! Don't eat my food!
I'm hungry! Hurry up and feed me!
A—
Th-This isn't good!
That was close...
C-Crap!
Kakyoin was watching.
He killed the scorpion.
Th-That baby really is...
Sh-Shit!
That's all you get.
Mr. Joestar, Polnareff, did you see that?!
Huh?
That baby isn't normal after all!
He just killed a scorpion!
In the blink of an eye! He stabbed it with a safety pin!
Kakyoin, hold on. What are you talking about?
That is not a normal baby!
He's not even a year old, but knew what a scorpion was...
And he killed it with those tiny hands!
A scorpion?
Where?!
In here!
The dead scorpion on the pin should be in here.
I-It's not here...
B-But it's true!
Where'd you hide it?!
Is it in your clothes?!
We got it, Kakyoin! That's enough! Stop!
Mr. Joestar!
I said this earlier, but you're tired.
Let's talk again tomorrow morning, after you've calmed down.
Okay, open wiiide! It's dewicious!
Oh? That's strange. I'm sure you're hungry, but you don't want any?
Say "ah."
S-Stop it!
Mr. Joestar! I'm sure of it now!
I don't know where he hid the scorpion, but he's a Stand user!
And I have the very thing to prove that!
Look at the wound on my arm! At what it says!
This is a warning.
Oh, my God!
Kakyoin, did you do that to yourself?
Eh?
K-Kakyoin, you've finally...
Oh, my God!
That big idiot!
Didn't you realize that if you showed them that, they'd think you were a fool?!
D-Did they misunderstand me even more?
A-At this rate... I have no other choice.
I'll have to use force!
Hierophant Green!
Bam
It's no use. He's totally lost his mind.
I-Impossible. I-I'm certain, Jotaro...
His Stand was the one in our dreams, Polnareff.
We can't fall asleep, Mr. Joestar.
Please, believe me. Everyone... If we fall asleep, we'll be killed.
Yes! I got away without being found out!
You guys lose!
I can't believe it...
So Kakyoin can't fight or travel with us anymore?
We'll figure out what to do with him in the morning.
Let's go to bed.
Polnareff, help me move Kakyoin.
Sure thing.
Jotaro, bring the sleeping bags.
Yeah.
Did you say something?
Not really. He's just heavy.
Now I can slice you all up and scatter your remains all over the desert!
I see.
Why are we in sleeping bags at an amusement park, like a bunch of idiots?
That's right!
Th-This is...
Jotaro! Mr. Joestar! Be careful!
I-I remember now.
W-We're inside a dream.
It's terrifying!
This is a world of nightmares!
Oh, so it's just a dream. Then I'm just gonna relax.
Don't have the same reaction I did!
Listen! What Kakyoin was saying is true!
Baby. Stand.
We're in enemy territory.
I know it's hard to believe, but the Stand user is that baby!
There's no one to wake you up now.
So there's absolutely no way for you to escape Death 13's world.
Now I'll finally finish you all.
he should already be somewhere in this world.
We have to find him!
Where are you, Kakyoin?
I have to apologize to him.
P-Polnareff, what's with your hairstyle?
Did you mess up styling it?
Eh?
Polnareff!
Curl
What?
M-My...
Pop!
Holy shit!
How are we supposed to fight this?
How?!
A-Anything can happen here.
It's a world where we're at his mercy!
Wait. There was just one rule.
The thing that'll
slice us into little pieces
Lali-ho!
Death 13
Manishu Booi
Lali-ho!
Star...
It's no use, Jotaro!
...Platinum!
Rumble
Th-That's odd... His Stand appeared.
Clank
Lali-ho! I'm a fake!
Loom...
This overwhelming power! This absolute fear!
It's so much fun!
A Stand is spiritual energy.
And dreams are the spirit unguarded!
and that's why you can't summon your Stands!
Although...
Whoosh
If you had
Death 13 will never have to face another Stand!
so I'll always win!
Now...
How about you give me a scream?
Lali-...ho?
Lali-ho!
Oh, it's just the fake one I made.
Wh-What?!
This one's not a fake!
Crush
This is the real Hierophant!
It's back!
It's Kakyoin!
Kakyoin's right there!
Bam!
I had Hierophant hide underground before I fell asleep.
Squish
Help me!
Now, it's time for your punishment, baby.
D-Damn it!
Let go!
Stop, Death 13!
He's completely in your blind spot.
If you keep resisting...
Even if you're just a baby, your neck will be broken.
Kakyoin!
Kakyoin. We owe you an apology.
I thought you might have become weak-minded.
I couldn't believe in you.
You were fighting this battle alone...
I'm sorry.
No, Polnareff. It couldn't be helped.
I only figured out a way to bring my Stand
So in a way, this is all thanks to you.
R-Really?
I-I can't help but feel a bit conflicted.
I'm kind of ashamed...
He's holding back because I'm a baby...
Kakyoin, your naiveté will cost your life!
You're still inside my nightmare world!
Hey, what's with the clouds?
and coming closer!
Kakyoin! Get Hierophant away from his back!
What?
I'll chop you in half!
I-Impossible!
He chopped himself...
Kakyoin!
Lali-ho!
Didn't you realize it?
Death 13 is just the head, arms, and the giant scythe.
You enormous fools!
Let's see.
Just kidding!
Kakyoin!
Y-You're all right?
Please look closer.
My Hierophant isn't so careless as to stay on his back forever.
He's not chopped in half!
He's taken on a string-like form...
And he's crawling into my ear!
M-My arm is moving on its own...
It's coming in...
Bam
I told you!
Now, if you don't wish to be destroyed from within...
How about you heal this wound on my arm?
so I'm sure you can heal a cut, right?
R-Right...
All right, everyone. Wake up!
Polnareff, wake up! Breakfast is ready!
I feel like I had a terrible dream...
Same here.
I can't remember it, but I still feel like it was terrifying.
Kakyoin!
A-Are you all right?
What do you mean?
Wh-What do I...
You were totally deranged last night!
H-Huh?
The wound is gone?
Now, I'll just go change the baby's diaper.
Huh?
Come on, it's morning.
So... Did you sleep well?
Oh, well!
Everyone has forgotten.
A Stand whose existence is completely forgotten...
What a unique Stand.
But I remember.
I'm the only one who brought a Stand into the dream.
We'll take you to a nearby town.
You need to go back to your mother.
But don't ever come near us again.
If you do, I'll punish you.
Just like this...
My poop?
Oh, Kakyoin.
I did.
Let's see. I'm sure you must be hungry by now.
Hey, no... You wouldn't...
Come on, it's dewicious! Open wiiide!
Oh, this again? I wonder what he's got against this stuff....
At this rate, I'll have to force-feed him.
Stop!
Hey, Mr. Joestar.
If you force him, he'll just hate it more.
In cases like this...
Coochie-coochie-coo... Coochie-coochie-coo...
See? Isn't it delicious?
Ba-dum-tss.
Hierophant Green

and are currently crossing the Red Sea, about to enter Egypt.
But!
Hey, old man. Something's not right.
Shouldn't you be heading directly west, to Egypt?
You seem to be heading toward that island.
but before we enter Egypt, we need to make a slight detour and meet someone.
He's a man who's extremely important to this journey.
An important man...?

I'm the one who let Avdol die.
There's no way I can make up for that.
To thank you for freeing me from the lamp...
It's an actual treasure!
...I'll grant you three wishes!
Can you bring someone back to life?

Hey, old man. Something's not right.
You're going the wrong way.
You seem to be heading toward that island.
Before we enter Egypt, we need to make a slight detour and meet someone.
He's a man who's extremely important to this journey.
An important man...?
Hey, now. Does someone actually live here?
It's such a tiny little island, and it looks deserted.
Indeed. Mr. Joestar, does he really live here?
He lives here by himself.
Eh? Who do you mean by "he"?
What? Indian curry?

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Hey. Someone's watching us from the grass over there.
What?
He's running away!
From the back, he looks...
Yeah. That's definitely familiar!
Hold it! Please wait!
Come, now. Are you hungry, Michael? Prince?
I kept the nutritional balance in mind and mixed in the shells you love, too.
There's more over here.
Get nice and fat so you'll be a tasty chicken, Lionel.
That man... He can't be...
It can't be...
Hold it!
I'll go talk to him. All of you, wait here.
My name is Joseph Joestar.
Go away! I won't hear it!
That voice...
D-Don't talk to me!
No one comes to see me with good news!
It's only when something bad happens! I don't want to hear it!
Go away!
Mr. Avdol!
Avdol...
Go away!
I-It can't be!
That's Avdol's...
father.
His father?
He left the world behind, and lives alone on this island.
I didn't tell any of you about this
the peace Avdol's father enjoys here could be compromised.
I didn't want to let that happen.
But telling him about his son Avdol's death
won't be easy to do...
Polnareff!
Avdol's death was not your fault.
No, it's my responsibility.
I have to carry that.
Is his father a Stand user, as well?
Yes, but I don't know what sort of Stand it is.
Leave this all to me.
I'll try talking to his father.
I'm still the one who let Avdol die.
I'm sure there's nothing I can do to make it up to his father...
How depressing.
This is pretty shiny.
I wonder if it drifted up from some sunken ship...
It's got barnacles all over it.
Looks like it's made of gold, but...
There's some creepy face carved into it.
But it looks valuable.
I'll try to rub these barnacles off.
Wh-What the?!
Km
I-It's gone!
Wh-What was that just now?
Did the air trapped inside burst out all of a sudden?
It's not Aladdin's magic lamp or anything...
That scared me to death.
Three!
You get three!
I'll grant your wishes.
Tell me three things you desire.
Wh-What the hell is this?!
My name is Cameo.
So tell me your three wishes.
Are you a new Stand user?!
Silver Chariot!
H-He's pretty good.
He's got incredible power...
Hey! Judging from your power, your user must be close by!
Who is it?!
Is the answer to that question your first wish?
Are you sure you want to make a boring wish like that?
Don't "I'll grant you three wishes" me!
Are you saying you could make me a super rich man right now?
Huh?!
Is that your first wish?
Just try it if you can! Stop messing with me, damn it!
Very well. I'll grant that wish.
Hail 2 U!
(Fortune be with you!)
Wha...
What the hell was that?
It wasn't the enemy's Stand?
What a strange guy.
I don't know what's going on, but I've got to be cautious.
Something's on this island.
I'll have to tell Mr. Joestar about what just happened.
It could have something to do with Avdol's father, as well.
What's that?
Th-This is... It can't be!
Th-This is gold from the Napoleonic era.
It's not an illusion, or a dream.
It's the real thing. It's a real treasure of gold!
A-Are you mocking me?!
No... If he were mocking me, when did he bury this here?
He didn't have time to bury this after I made my wish.
How'd he bring this here?
Tell me your second wish.
I shall grant it for you.
Y-You bastard! What are you plotting, doing something like this?!
Like I'd fall for your trap!
If you're my enemy, act like it, and fight me!
Or I'm going to take this treasure.
Is the answer to that question your second wish?
Are you sure you want to make a boring wish like that?
To thank you for letting me out of that lamp, I will grant you any wish.
Y-You bastard!
All right... Then, make me...
A manga artist!
That was my dream as a kid!
I want to be bigger than Disney!
Don't make me some pathetic sap.
I'm going to build Polnareffland!
W-Wait, hold on.
Hold on just a second.
Wait, just wait...
Actually, I want a girlfriend!
More than wealth and fame...
I want love!
and a relationship like we're bound by the red string of fate...
I want to meet a girl who feels the way I do!
If you can do that, do it right now, damn it!
A girl, eh? Very well.
N-No, wait. Actually, hold on a sec.
Can you...
bring someone back...
Is the answer to that question your second wi—
Oh, stop that already!
Bring my friend, Avdol, back to life!
You can't do that, can you?!
Very well.
I'll grant that wish.
Wh-What?!
Silver Chariot
Jean Pierre Polnareff
You said... you can grant that?
so I'll grant them one at a time.
I'll start with your second wish, your sister.
Hail 2 U!
H-Hold it! Who the hell are you?!
Why would you—
Wh-What was that sound?
That sound I just heard...
I-It sounded like the ground was being dug up...
I hear the digging again!
I-It can't be!
A-A woman crying?
Who the hell is there?!
Th-This is...
H-Hair...
A woman's footsteps...
I-Impossible!
It can't be... It can't be true...
My little sister is buried back at home in France...
Who the hell are you?
Don't... come near me...
I'm in pain...
That voice...
Sherry!
Where did Polnareff go?
He's not here, either.
He couldn't have run into the enemy, could he?
Sh-Sherry...
Is that you?
It is you, isn't it?
Wh-Where are you going?
Where are you going, Sherry?!
It's me! Please wait!
Why are you running away, Sherry?!
Where are you? Please, let me see you!
Please wait, Sherry!
Let me see your face... Just one more time...
Brother!
Brother! Raise me higher! Higher!
Yay! Now spin!
Oh, how lovely! I've been wanting a new umbrella.
Thank you, Brother.
I'm off, now.
Sherry! Sherry!
What... is this dead bird?
It looks like it was bitten apart.
Sherry!
Are you there? Why are you running?
It's me, your older brother!
Because... I'm covered in dirt...
And my hair is all scraggly...
Don't worry about that, Sherry!
No matter how dirty, you're still you.
Why are you crying?
Why are you sad, Sherry?
Sherry...
No.
No, don't.
Don't come near me!
B-But why? What are you saying?
Because...
Hate you? Have I ever said that I hated you?
You have.
When we were kids...
When I gave your tropical fish to the cat...
You got really angry and said you hated me.
Yeah, I was angry then, but I've always loved you!
Even now!
Really?
You've always loved me?
Of course I have!
You'll love me, no matter what I do?
I'll always love you, no matter what.
You don't know how much I've missed you.
I see.
Sherry, please look this way.
Please show me your face.
Why are you crying? Why are you sad?
Sad?
No, Brother.
I'm not crying because I'm sad.
Huh? Then...
I'm...
happy...
Ch-Chariot!
Sher... ry...
I'm sorry that I bit you, Brother.
My body's not complete yet.
But if I eat your flesh, Brother, I'll return to normal.
It's okay if I eat you, right?
You always did what I asked you to.
Cameo!
What is it?
Y-You bastard!
What? Do you have a complaint?
I granted your wish.
My only power is to grant wishes. The rest is up to you.
Th-Then I'll tell you my third wish!
Make my sister...
Make my sister...
Make my sister disappear! Return her to the earth!
Nooope!
What?!
You still don't get it, Polnareff?
I'm a Stand!
I'm the Stand that suggests the Judgment card!
My power is to grant the wishes people hold
You made your own sister, from your own heart!
Y-You...
Anything you've created, I cannot unmake.
I win this battle!
Bam
By the way...
but you've already made your third wish, haven't you?
You—
You don't mean...

dying because your sister ate you.
all of his greatest weaknesses come to light.
You didn't even think about how unnatural it is to bring someone back to life.
You want to believe that the one you loved is still alive somewhere on this Earth.
You hope that they'll suddenly pop in tomorrow and say, "Good morning."
By the way...

Av... dol...
My fingers... fell apart.
Polnareff!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
This is your fault...
Because of you, I... I...
Ended up like this...
Avdol... I... I made you...
I...
I'll have you pay for this, Polnareff.
With...
your body!
I'll get better if I eat, right?
Right?
Brother!
What's the matter, Brother?
S-Stay away! Stay away from me!
Both of you... Return to the ground, please!
Why? You're the one who brought us back.
It's your turn to enter the ground!
I-I was so freaked out that I forgot to summon Chariot.
I was so caught up in my wish that I forgot to use my Stand...
Get away from me, please!
Get away from me!
What?!
"Please"? Nope! You don't have any wishes left.
I've already granted your three wishes.
You don't get any more.
Stop!
Hail 2 U!
Make sure you cry and scream all you can before you die.
You're in this island's backwoods.
Your voice won't reach the shore. No one will come to save you.
I-It's no use. I'm done for...
I'm going to die. I'm beaten.
Sherry...
Avdol...
Even though they're just clay dolls, it's not so bad being defeated by them.
Avdol, just like you said, you died because of me.
I have no complaints about whatever happens to me.
What...?
Are my eyes so blurry that I'm seeing double?
It looks like there are two Avdols.
Of course there's only one clay doll.
If I'm seeing things, I guess that means death is really close now.
Not to mention how much I'm bleeding...
Then... I guess I'll die.
Goodbye, Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, Jotaro...
I pray for your victory.
Avdol, for you...
I'll atone in the next world...
What?! Impossible!
I knew it! Thereanother Avdol!
My eyes weren't playing tricks!
Besides the clay doll Avdol...
There's another Avdol!
Magician's Red!
Impossible! He should have been dead!
He was stabbed by the Hanged Man, Centerfold!
He should be dead...
Tsk, tsk.
Mohammed Avdol!
Yes, I am!
Bam
I-Is it really you?
Tsk, tsk.
Rumble
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
I-Is it the real you?
Polnareff, you haven't matured a bit.
You're still going on
Impossible!
There's no way you can be alive!
Hol Horse blew your brains out, and you died on the spot.
Indeed, I was shot. Right in the forehead...
Meaning, the bullet grazed me.
I guess this is what you call a blessing in disguise.
so it never reached my brain, and wasn't a mortal wound.
But I did completely lose consciousness.
Cameo of the Judgment card, was it?
I'll give you Hell!
Hell 2 U!
The third wish... Just the third wish...
It's real.
It came true.
Judgment
Cameo
Mohammed Avdol is alive.
This bad news...
Shouldn't you, Cameo?
That's right! I have to tell them! I have to let them know!
Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, and Jotaro!
This is, indeed, very surprising news.
But I can turn that news into this:
but also killed Avdol, who was actually still alive!
Oh! I shall change it into good news!
Magician's Red!
Whoa, there.
Avdol!
This Stand is rather powerful...
Be careful! It's not just power. He's got speed, too.
Avdol, is that all you've got?
It looks like I'll be able to share my good news after all.
May fortune...
be with you both!
What?!
Hail 2 U!
Brother...
No. My Sherry...
Sherry... died.
You're...
just...
a clay doll!
Brother...
Polnareff.
My apologies. I take back my statement that you hadn't matured.
No, you were right.
I should be the one to apologize.
This battle has been decided.
Avdol! Tell me your three wishes! I shall grant them for you.
Before you die for real this time!
Go ahead! Give it a shot.
Bastard! He's making fools of us!
Avdol, ignore him.
Avdol, are you listening to me?
No...
Make it four.
Wha?!
What?
Wishes. I mean wishes!
I wish to make the three wishes into four.
Tsk, tsk.
You can't be serious...
Are you denying my wish? Cameo, you're the one that offered!
I will have you keep your promise!
You still insist upon this futile contest of power?
Such a weak kick.
What?!
Yes! Awesome!
Tsk, tsk. My first wish was to make you scream in pain.
It came true.
I-Impossible! You're strong! You're much stronger than earlier!
The wound left after I was stabbed by the Hanged Man hasn't completely healed yet.
Wha—
I was finally able to stand again just three days ago in India.
I was able to take a plane here, so the trip was very easy.
Nothing less from you, Avdol!
Now, my second wish...
To make you scream in fear! And my third wish...
To make you cry in regret!
Th-That bastard! He's running away!
Shh. Be quiet, Polnareff.
With that kind of power and speed...
Is he here?
He should be hiding very close by.
Could that be—
Shh!
The user is hiding beneath the ground?!
He had the nerve to use my sister, so I'll show him Hell!
Bastard!
Grind
I'm gonna drop all sorts of things in there...
Like dirt, sand...
A spider...
And ants...
And a match.
Bastard! I'm not done yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hey, Polnareff.
and take a piss together?
Tsk, tsk.
Huh?
I somehow made it.
C'mon! Laugh, Polnareff!
Laugh! Laugh, Polnareff!
Avdol... Did your personality change?
You weren't a guy who thought up perverse stuff like this before.
It's not because you were shot in the head, is it?
Come now, aim for it!
Right!
Please forgive me!
My fourth wish. That is...
To not listen to wishes.
Magician's Red won't forgive you.
Not happening.
Bam
Ba-dum-tss!
Magician's Red
Mohammed Avdol
Hey! You'll never believe this, guys!
Who do you think I met?
Polnareff! We were worried about you!
Where did you get those wounds?
Were you attacked?
Who cares about my wounds?
Don't let your back go out in shock, Kakyoin.
Who do you think I met, Mr. Joestar?
Behold and rejoice!
Tum-ta-da-da!
Here he is!
That bastard Avdol was alive!
Well, let's go.
I'll help you carry your luggage.
Hey, Avdol.
It's been a while. How are you?
Avdol, is that wound on your back all right?
It's fine. A bit stiff, though.
Hey...
Has it really been two weeks?
Hey...
Jotaro, you still wear all that stuff? Don't you get hot?
W-Wait a minute, you guys!
Hey! I said wait, you assholes!
Hey, what's the deal with that attitude?!
A guy who was dead came back to life!
Oh, Polnareff, I'm sorry. When I said I buried Avdol in India...
That was a lie.
Casual
Wh— Wh— What?!
It was Mr. Joestar and Jotaro who tended the wounds on my head and back in India.
Y-You assholes knew that Avdol was still alive in India, and you didn't tell me?!
You, too, Kakyoin?!
I only found out the day after.
But we couldn't let the enemy know.
And since you have such a big mouth...
If you'd let the secret slip, Avdol couldn't have recovered in peace.
Oh, yeah, Avdol!
Your dad is on this island!
Let's let him know you're here!
Oh, that was me in disguise.
Wh-What?!
Go away!
No one comes to see me with good news!
I don't want to hear it!
Avdol's death was not your fault.
Did you have to go that far?!
Hey, now. There's no reason to cry.
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be this hurt.
I'm sorry, Polnareff.
A reason?
A little shopping?
It was a very conspicuous purchase.
Now, everyone, we're gonna ride that and leave!
Polnareff, cheer up already. Come on.
It's almost here!
Wait, what's almost here?
There's nothing—
What?!
A submarine?!
That's right. From here, we'll ride to Egypt in this!
Y-You're kidding! You really bought something like this?!
Next Episode Preview
How about this glistening design?
A submarine, huh...
Perhaps a refreshing white would be best.
Hurry up and make some coffee.
I just don't know which one to pick.
Kakyoin, why are you taking that cup?
Hello? Oh, is that you, Joseph?

it is the most beautiful sea in the world.
Egypt
Sudan
Saudi Arabia
nor rivers that flow into it.
It is an unsullied sea.
Hey, can you drive this thing, Avdol?
Tsk, tsk. No problem.
I can drive it, too!
You're not driving this thing.
Hmph. My grandson is so harsh.
A submarine, huh...
Yeah. This is a vessel that the rich use to explore the sea floor for pleasure.
As you see, it even has windows.
Oooh! Nice!
Whoa.
I've always kind of liked this sort of thing.
I wish I could've ridden it with a cute girl...
I see you haven't changed, Polnareff.
We didn't come here to play.
What's that?
It's a sonar.
Wow...
All clear. Nothing is coming toward us.
With this, we can detect anyone trying to attack us, from any direction.
But if we were to be attacked in here, we'd have nowhere to run.
We are 60 meters below sea level, after all.
Wow... I guess this is to be expected of pleasure cruiser for the wealthy.
A refrigerator, coffee maker...
Not to mention the latest satellite phones.
Get me a drink, Kakyoin.
I'm parched.
I'd like one, too.
All right.
Is cola okay?
Hey, old man.
What's the matter? You're just standing there.
Everyone, be quiet for a moment.
I'm going to make a phone call.
A phone call? To where?
It must be very important, if you're calling from here.
Yes, it's an important and delicate matter.
Oh, I don't know... Which one should I pick?
but it's for the charity event tomorrow.
Maybe a refreshing white would be better...
What do you think, Rosas?
They both look lovely on you, Madam.
Coming!
Hello?
Oh, Joseph, it's you.
It's been a while. By the way, where are you?
It's a bit hard to hear you.
R-Right... I'm at a hotel.
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be
Oh, goodness. That must be very difficult.
Traveling on business to another country right after going to Japan...
It's been nearly a month now, hasn't it?
Y-Yes. I'm sorry.
By the way, Suzie...
Have you spoken to Holly?
Yes, I just spoke to her on the phone yesterday.
She mentioned catching a cold
She says it's not serious, but I'm thinking about going to visit her.
No. There's no need for that. I'm sure she'll recover quickly.
You're such a worrywart...
This was the important conversation?
Yes, I'll check up on that myself.
so he needs to check in now and then
to make sure she doesn't visit Miss Holly in Japan, and discover the truth.
Right.
Meaning that she...
Right.
Of course, she hasn't been told anything.
It's all right. There's nothing to worry about.
Well...
I see. All right.
I'll hold off on going to Japan.
By the way, Joseph, I have something I'd like to ask you.
I'm trying to decide between a white dress and a purple one...
R-Right. Hey, Suzie, could you let me talk to Rosas?
What?
Madam.
Have you considered your blue dress?
It should be in the back of the closet.
That's right. I'll go take a look.
Hello, it's me, Master Joseph.
Where's Suzie?
She has left the room.
I see...
Actually, right now, I'm calling you from the submarine that I spoke of.
So you were safely able to meet up with Master Avdol?
So, how is Holly doing?
Have you gotten hold of the doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation?
Well, actually...
Miss Holly says on the phone that she only has a cold.
But her condition worsens by the day.
Master Joseph! Perhaps we should tell Madam Joestar the truth.
No.
There's no need for that.
We will end all of this very soon.
It's best if she can just go back to her daily routine.
Do not let Suzie know anything under any circumstances.
I'll contact you again.
As you wish. I pray for your safe return.
Oh, Rosas, did you already hang up? I wasn't done talking to him!
Madam...
Oh, well. It's fine. Let's have some tea.
You'll have some, too, won't you, Rosas?
Oh?
M-Madam!
Please have a seat. I shall serve you the tea.
Really?
You have my condolences, Mr. Joestar.
But don't worry. We're here with you.
Egypt's right in front of us.
We must defeat DIO as soon as possible and save Miss Holly.
That is exactly why I have returned.
Right. Thank you, everyone.
This is actually pretty easy.
For crying out loud!
Hey, don't get overconfident.
Yeah, I know. All right! Let's speed up just a little bi—
Polnareff!
That wasn't me!
I'm so tired. Are we there yet?
One, two, three, four, five...
Oh, there are exactly five cups.
Hey!
Make it yourself, then.
Hey. I can see the coast of Africa.
Near this coral reef, there is an underwater tunnel formed by erosion.
The exit is 200 meters inland.
So, we've finally made it to Egypt.
Yeah, finally.
Egypt, huh...
Yes, finally.
What's wrong?
Nah, I'm just really happy.
Hey, Kakyoin.
That's odd. I guess I wasn't paying attention.
I could have sworn it was five...
Wh—
What?!
Old man!
Mr. Joestar!
Screech
Impossible!
It's a Stand! At some point, a Stand got into the submarine!
I-It disappeared!
No, that's not it!
It transformed!
It turned into one of the gauges!
Seriously?
We're at the coral reef!
Mr. Joestar is unconscious, but his wounds aren't deep.
It was just his artificial hand.
Th-The phone?!
Ignore it, Polnareff!
It's the High Priestess.
The enemy is using the Stand that suggests The High Priestess.
You know of it?
I've heard of it.
The name of the the Stand user is Rose.
so the user is probably on the surface.
What's its power?
So that includes plastic and vinyl, as well.
B-But where did it sneak in here from?
I see... So that's how.
How simple... So it cut a hole and came in?
It broke the surfacing system.
We're sinking faster!
We're suddenly low on oxygen.
Navigation is impossible!
Damn it! Shut up! Who the hell is it at a time like this?
Jotaro?!
Hey! Don't touch things without thinki—
Hi, Joseph, it's me!
I wasn't done talking to you, so I made Rosas give me the number.
Why aren't you speaking?
I hear something like... a siren?
And the sound of water... Is a bathtub overflowing?
Sorry, but the old man can't come to the phone right now.
Jotaro?! Where's Joseph?
You should be in Japan.
Answer me, Jotaro.
There's nothing to worry about, Grandma Suzie.
The old man has me.
Later. Once things calm down, we'll call you back.
Jotaro!
Hold on! We're going to hit the sea floor!
Oh my God!
I knew this would happen!
I'm never getting in a submarine again.
High Priestess
Rose
How strange...
I could get through until a moment ago.
But...
Why was Jotaro...?
H-Hey, the oxygen's getting thin in here.
Kakyoin.
Did you see which gauge the Stand turned into?
It...
No! Jotaro! It already moved!
It's right behind Kakyoin!
Hierophant Green!
Slice!
Kakyoin!
Roar
Everyone, head toward the door.
It's become part of the hull's surface and started moving.
You say that, but...
If we stay in this room, we'll all get badly hurt.
Are you all right, Kakyoin?
Y-Yes...
Everyone, head to the next room!
We'll seal this room and trap it inside!
I-Impossible!
I-I have to take my hands off!
What?!
Yes! We got it!
Th-That was close...
Apparently, it can't move faster than Star Platinum.
What should we do with it?
Jotaro, don't hesitate!
Aye-aye, sir.
B-Bastard...
Bang
It turned into a razor!
I-Impossible...
It's strong!
I can't believe it landed an attack on Jotaro.
What an enemy...
Wh-What's going on?
Shut up, old man.
If we touch it, we'll get attacked.
Magician's Red!
Silver Chariot!
It's hard.
Chariot's rapier can't pierce it!
We should strike while it's visible.
Everyone, stand back.
Th-There's still oxygen over here.
But it's just a matter of time.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Leave it, Jotaro! It'll transform again.
We'll figure out how to fight it then!
I, Jotaro Kujo, will end you myself.
Bam
What?! Jotaro, you answered a phone call from Suzie?
Damn it... You shouldn't have done that.
Well, whatever. Anyway, we'll talk when we get out of this predicament.
Leave it to me.
Do you have a plan?
Yeah... A brilliant one.
I, Joseph Joestar, have been in a number of situations like this.
Why was Jotaro with Joseph?
Have you heard anything?
N-No...
But... I was happy to hear that boy's voice after so long.
but deep down, he's a sweet child who cares very much for his family.
I'm sure he's helping Joseph out in many ways.
Yes, Madam. Master Jotaro and Master Joseph
To save Miss Holly, someone very dear to them, from the evil curse.
What do we do now?
I'm not sure if it's us or the Stand that's trapped.
Sooner or later, it'll cut its way out of that room and get here!
We are definitely at a disadvantage in this closed space filled with machines.
This submarine is done for.
We just need to surface in Egypt!
But we're 40 meters below sea level!
Now we're scuba diving?
Hurry up! Step on it!
Good grief.
But I can't make the necessary preparations to dive with this hand.
Help me out, Jotaro.
Do it yourself.
Next Episode Preview
First of all, make sure not to panic.
The ocean floor is so beautiful...
If it's okay, you'll do this...
If we're in trouble, do this.
I think I'd like to see your face sometime.
Episode 24
The High Priestess, Part 2
Wind Knights Lot, a valley town surrounded by sharp cliffs.
Built in the Middle Ages to train knights...
...it now serves as a prison where inmates mine for coal.
Farms and fishing give the town life.
Its population including prisoners: 517.
A terrible doom will soon visit them!
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 5: Knights of Darkness
Everyone is hard at work.
Things still appear peaceful.
But I know Dio is around here somewhere.
What happened?
Um, well, Speedwagon has been begging me for a while.
So I thought I'd help him create just a little Hamon.
And my finger kind of slipped.
I'm terribly sorry, Speedwagon.
W-Why...you...
It's a kid, sir.
Rather spry for such a young cutpurse, eh?
Why are you just standing there?!
All of our money is in that bag!
That little devil!
A grab and dash in a single move.
Let's see...
I think he can serve us as a guide.
H-He's not sinking!
That was a nice sound, JoJo.
Your Overdrive passed through perfectly.
Do you think this is the spot?
No, a couple steps to the left.
I'll bet two pounds on it.
It shocked me!
Nice catch!
H-Huh? What's going on?
Who are you?
Something's wrong with the boy.
Did I use too much Hamon?
The boy is not the only thing that's wrong.
Look around.
This is...!
A graveyard!
Looks like we were the ones nicely caught in this trap.
The boy was under some sort of hypnosis.
Jonathan, above you!
The sun is gone.
Time for your lives to go with it!
Dio!
T-They're crawling out!
I-I've been preparing myself for this moment.
But I can't help being dismayed.
I'm sweating here!
That arrogant monster is right there in the flesh!
He repaid Sir Joestar's love with bloody betrayal!
I won't let him get away with it!
So that is Dio.
I see. He and his zombies can't operate during the day.
So he hypnotized the boy and lured us
A man of such guile must not have the mask.
We have to destroy him somehow!
Zombie knights!
What's your name?
P-Poco!
All right, Poco.
Hang on tight!
Let's move, JoJo!
Yes, sir!
Zoom Punch!
Wow!
Dio Brando...
We've never met before.
But I say this to the mask that has awakened you.
We meet at last.
Hey, baby! 
Come on down!
You're a cocky one for an insect.
I am the pinnacle of life.
A new being that will create the future.
I am incapable of sinking down to a human level.
I've never felt such malice! He already fancies himself a tyrant!
This is the only scar that has yet to heal after my fight with JoJo.
Come, conjurer!
Let your blood salve this wound!
How many lives have you taken to erase those scars?
How many slices of bread have you eaten?
Dio!
Baron Zeppeli!
I will handle this.
You're going to suffer!
Solar Hamon, shine on me!
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
He did it! 
How feeble!
I-It's freezing!
No!
Zeppeli was it?
Your energy comes from the flow of your blood.
So if your blood vessels are frozen, you're powerless.
Know that I have absolute control over my body.
I vaporized the moisture in my left arm.
When it vaporized, it sucked up heat, flash freezing your arm.
And now!
Buffoon!
I'll smash through your arm and your skull like a vase!
Dio, I'm ending your madness!
I feel Dio's wicked blood flowing through his hand.
I'll take that as a compliment.
But you did quite well to stop my fist.
I must say I'm impressed.
JoJo!
JoJo, if I were you, I'd keep my hands to myself.
Take this, Dio!
Once your arm is frozen, blood will no longer flow through it!
Your Hamon energy will not work!
H-He's too strong!
He's five times as strong as both of us together!
No! He'll freeze JoJo's arm just like mine!
I can't let JoJo be hurt!
Baron Zeppeli!
T-This can't be!
S-So cold!
It's so cold it burns!
My skin is peeling like I touched cold metal!
Baron Zeppeli's arm!
Without circulation, it will rot!
He can't be stopped without solar Hamon!
Can we stand against him?!
Hamon?
A breathing trick?
If you want to huff and puff...
T-The ground is shaking!
...then you should trumpet a fanfare in my honor!
Tarukus! Black Knight Blueford!
This fight is beneath me. Arise!
Make their screams a fanfare dedicated to me!
W-Who are these creeps?!
Poco, run and hide!
In the 16th century, an ill-fated queen was slain by Elizabeth I.
You, fierce knights who served Queen Mary Stuart!
Settle this!
I leave the extermination of these pests to you!
Enjoy.
He lifted and crushed that boulder with just one finger!
Those two zombies are moving for JoJo!
T-There's no way he can handle both.
If I had a little circulation...
Then what?
I could heal my arm a bit.
Is there some way to thaw my arm?
Baron Zeppeli, you need to heat up your arm, right?
Y-You have a plan?!
How about this?!
Speedwagon!
In the Arctic, people treat frostbite by putting the wound inside a seal!
Zoom Punch!
Your blood is mine!
H-He's draining my blood!
Speedwagon, I...
I didn't come here to slow you and Jonathan down!
If he can drink blood through his hair, I can send Hamon up it!
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
It's not working!
Is this bloodsucker weakening my Hamon?!
I didn't give you enough credit.
I thought you'd be the type to flee.
I apologize.
I'll accept your apology if we live through this.
I-I need to get my arm into fighting form and fast!
That sight chills me more than your arm did!
That blade makes Jonathan's 195 cm frame look tiny!
That sinister black hair! Those faces!
They have secrets!
I can read people, and those two have secrets for sure!
Every Englishman knows the legendary knights Tarukus and Blueford.
Even history bows to my will!
Long ago, around 1565, two queens fought in a war of royal succession:
Queen Elizabeth I...
...and the beautiful, 23-year-old Mary Stuart.
The great knights Tarukus and Blueford were her loyal vassals.
The pair had lost their families and Mary accepted them with warmth.
Even the strongest man seeks respite, not in romance, in something larger.
The pair found that in Mary.
They swore to honor her, even if it meant ending their lives.
But one day, Mary's husband Lord Darnley unexpectedly died.
Seeing a chance, Elizabeth blamed Mary for Darnley's death.
The land turned against Mary, and she was caught and imprisoned.
Tarukus and Blueford fought to free her.
Elizabeth bargained with the two thorns in her side.
Turn yourselves in.
If you do so, I'll spare Mary's life.
There is no reason to refuse her offer.
I have no regrets.
The two were arrested...
...and executed.
Here are a few words as a parting gift: Mary is already dead.
You were deceived.
See that lying over there like a pile of rubbish?
That's your Mary.
You vile fiend, Elizabeth! You betrayed us!
With my final breath I curse you and all of your descendants!
I lay my curse upon you!
The knights were beheaded.
It is said that Tarukus's neck was stiff with fury, and took several axes to cut.
Blueford's hair coiled around his executioner's feet...
...digging into his killer's flesh.
And the story of their delusion gave me goose bumps.
These legendary heroes cursed the world.
I dug them up and gave them life!
I turned them into unstoppable revenants!
We swore fealty to Lord Dio!
We have come to end the world! Death to everyone!
S-Such hatred! Their scorn has been amplified!
Dio's made heroes into monsters!
Can JoJo overcome this delusion?
Hamon that burns in my left hand!
Scarlet Overdrive!
A-Astounding!
I-I had forgotten! Much rides on Jonathan's shoulders!
His father's death and his hope for the future!
And the hope of us all!
This boy has some skill.
He's perfect for warming up after a 300-year nap.
This one's flesh belongs to me!
I'll gnaw on his yummy cartilage!
Another zombie!
This is no place for pawns.
W-What speed!
Lord Dio, this young man has a great deal of spirit!
I ask for the pleasure of drawing the curtains on his life!
As you will.
Tarukus, stand aside.
Black Knight Blueford, a supreme fighter and utterly without mercy!
You can practically feel the pride and skill flowing from him!
This is so strange. I learned about him in school.
And now he's coming to kill me.
I have to steady my breathing and relax my muscles!
O-Oh, no! He's got both arms behind his back!
Which will he attack with? Or will he kick?
No! He uses his hair!
N-No!
You've got a keen eye if you dodged my hair's Danse Macabre.
I'm enjoying this.
Jonathan!
This is bad! He can't breathe down there!
He won't be able to use Hamon!
We have to go help him!
T-Tarukus!
Damn! We can't even help Jonathan!
It's already over. He can't touch Blueford underwater.
My supervision is no longer needed here.
I'll now turn Wind Knights Lot into a town of zombies!
Just one more night, then they will spread through England like a plague!
I-I need to breathe to create Hamon!
Just one breath!
Now swim for the surface, boy.
You can't breathe down here, and my armor weighs me down.
I won't use my sword.
This is a duel between heroes!
You need to make your move before you drown!
Can I make it to the surface before he does?
What are my odds?
As death threatened to take JoJo, his explosive inner reserves awakened!
An ordinary man, his lungs screaming for breath, would swim upward.
But not JoJo!
Instead, he turned and swam deeper toward the bottom!
W-What is he thinking?
Hmm? Danny won't let go of your toy gun?
It's because you're trying to take it away.
Change your thinking. Try giving it to Danny instead.
Wind Knights Lot is a coal town.
That means the ground sunk long ago.
There!
There should be air trapped under the rocks!
I found it!
With just one breath, my blood's beat has returned!
I-Impossible!
The tables have turned on you!
Hamon will travel even better down here!
Underwater...
Turquoise Blue Overdrive!
Next episode
Blueford is a mess!
I'm a master of slaughter!
This pain is nothing.
You will be destined to die.

Th-This isn't good!
Don't lose your cool.
It's times like these when men need to be prepared.
It's hard to get this stuff on without my artificial hand.
Who here has scuba dived before?
Not me.
No.
I haven't.
The High Priestess is still attacking from the next room!
Quickly, teach us how to dive!
Don't panic, Avdol.
Above all, never panic.
That's the most important thing in scuba diving.
At the surface, there's one atmosphere of pressure.
If we try to surface immediately, our lungs and blood vessels will burst.
We have to go up slowly, so our bodies can adjust.
Now...
I'm going to let water in.
This is a regulator. There's a valve inside
that only lets in air from the tank when you breathe in.
When you exhale, your breath comes out the left side.
What about your spit?
What happens if spit or phlegm comes out while you're underwater?
That stuff just comes out here.
We'll use hand signals instead.
Let's keep things simple and use two.
When everything is fine, we'll use this to say "okay."
When things aren't good, use this.
That's a good point.
Aww, but I know a hand signal message, too.
"Your underwear is showing."
Yeah!
We're under attack and could die anytime!
This room will soon fill with water.
P-Polnareff!
Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders
The High Priestess, Part 2
Wh-When did...
I-It had already transformed into a regulator!
Th-That bastard...
It's going to go in through his mouth and tear him apart!
This is bad!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
It's too late for that!
C-Crap!
It's inside Polnareff now!
Wh-What should we do?
Hierophant Green!
Hermit Purple!
Wriggle
H-Hey...
I got it before it went down his throat, Kakyoin!
Me, too!
We did it!
All right, keep hold of it.
Look! It's transforming into something else.
Clang
A speargun! It turned into a speargun!
Emerald Splash!
Silver Chariot!
Now!
It's reloading!
This isn't good!
H-Hurry!
Hurry up, old man!
I know, I know!
Th-That was close...
It's too soon to relax.
The bastard knows exactly how to hit us where it hurts.
Polnareff, are you all right?
I-I'm fine...
You guys saved me.
Merci beaucoup.
The sea floor is so beautiful.
I wish I could have come here on vacation.
This is no time to take it easy.
We must surface before our oxygen runs out.
Will it come after us?
I can't see that happening.
but she can't become fish, water, or sea foam.
Just watch your back while you swim.
Be careful of moving pebbles and stones, too.
Look, it's a sea tunnel.
Our depth is seven meters.
We're finally at the Egyptian shore!
Swim along these rocks to the surface.
What?!
Th-This is...
The S-Stand... It was disguised as the sea bed!
W-We're being sucked into its mouth!
Crush
I-Impossible!
How is it so gigantic?!
What's with its size?! What's this Stand's power?!
It was so small earlier!
You boys are so slow.
that means the sea bed is mostly mineral, too?
The Stand's power has increased because its user is nearby!
She must be very close!
Precisely!
so you'll never see my face.
I-I wonder exactly where in the Stand we are.
We're still inside its mouth.
We weren't sucked down its throat.
Hey, Jotaro!
Jotaro, you're my type, so this will be hard for me.
It's too bad I have to make my Stand, the High Priestess, digest you.
If only we had met under other circumstances. How sad.
But if I kill you, Lord DIO will praise me.
Don't hate me!
Good grief. Do I have to say that?
Say it! Come on, just hurry up and say it!
Say what?
I see...
I might fall for you.
I-I think she's probably gorgeous!
Indeed. I get the impression of an elegant woman.
Doesn't she sound like the actress, Audrey Hepburn?
If only I were thirty years younger.
You bastards! You don't mean any of that!
I'll kill you!
Holy shit!
Everyone, look!
Wh-What is that?
I-It's a tongue!
Jotaro!
Jotaro!
Where's Jotaro going to land?
Its teeth! The molars!
Jotaro! Dodge!
You'll be crushed!
You want to pit your strength against mine?
S-So strong...
Jotaro! These teeth are as hard as diamonds!
I'll kill you first!
Save Jotaro!
Don't get in my way!
It's the tongue again!
Magician's Red!
Th-This isn't good!
Pull him out!
Jotaro!
High Priestess
Rose
Jotaro!
J-Jotaro was crushed by the teeth...
J-Jotaro...
We didn't make it in time?
No, wait. I can hear something.
It sounds a bit far away...
It sounds like it's getting closer.
Th-This voice...
The teeth! It's coming from inside the teeth!
Everyone, brace yourselves!
Huh?
he managed to dig his way out.
Oh, my God!
For crying out loud...
As usual, that Stand's power is immense.
Hey, we're getting out of here.
Ker-Splash
but I still busted them.
I guess your diamonds were a little low on calcium.
That was awful...
Hey, there's a woman passed out over there.
I assume it's Rose, user of the High Priestess.
What should we do? Is she incapacitated?
Maybe I'll go see if she's hot or not!
Looks like she's got a nice figure.
Let's see...
Well? Polnareff?
N-No comment...
Stop! Don't look!
Her teeth are all busted, so there's no point in looking!
Anyway, we've finally made it to Egypt.
Indeed. In a jet, this trip would've taken twenty hours.
But it took us thirty days.
We visited many places.
Inside a brain, and even inside a dream.
A dream? What are you talking about, Kakyoin?
Hey, now. It's morning. Wake up already.
Oh, right. You guys didn't know about that.
Well, whatever. Let's go.
The Stand.
Around the World in 80 Days.
Joseph Joestar once described their journey in that way.
Traveling from Tokyo to Hong Kong, they encountered Tower of Gray.
In Singapore, they encountered Ebony Devil and Yellow Temperance.
In Calcutta, India, it was Hanged Man and Emperor.
In Varanasi, India, the Empress.
Near the Pakistani border, Wheel of Fortune.
In the mountains of Pakistan, Justice.
In Karachi, Pakistan, the Lovers.
In the deserts of the United Arab Emirates, the Sun.
In Saudi Arabia, Death 13.
On a small island in the Red Sea, Judgment.
And now, on the Red Sea floor, the High Priestess.
they have finally arrived in Egypt.
Red Sea
Egypt
Aswan
Where they surfaced
Only a few of the Tarot Cards remain.
But Jojo and the others do not yet know
that new threats still await them.
That's...
One, two, three... nine.
Nine of them? Men and women...
Huh?
Have the flies swarming nearby been eliminated?
The Speedwagon Foundation...
I can't let my guard down for a minute. For pity's sake...
I've gotten quite used to this body now.
Do you feel it, Jonathan?
Your descendants are coming closer.
It's so very cruel...
Oh, I see. So Jotaro is helping you with work.
Good, very good.
Hmph.
He's got a long way to go, compared to me.
So, is your work that important?
Yeah. It's a very important task.
I can't mess it up.
But if we work together, we will get it done.
Say, Joseph. Could I speak to Jotaro?
Sure, but what about?
Nothing much.
No.
Jotaro.
It's me.
I've heard all about it, Jotaro!
Do your best. Take care of your grandfather for me.
Yeah.
I'm sure if you work together, you Joestar men
I truly believe that.
Grandma Suzie, you...
Hm? What's the matter?
It's nothing.
All right, I'm hanging up. I look forward to good news. Ciao!
Madam...
It has been thirty years now that I've worked for the Joestar family.
B-But this is the first time something like this has...
Oh, you're overreacting.
It's just a business trip, isn't it?
W-Well...
It's so troublesome when men act selfish.
But I'm used to it by now.
The Joestar family has been
I'm sure she'll say so, too, and laugh it all off.
What's wrong, Jotaro?
It's nothing.
All right, let's go.
The ties to DIO that we've had for a century...
We Joestars will finally bring that to an end.
It's won't just be us.
Hey, Mr. Joestar!
We got the car!
Let's hurry up and go.
Let's get where we're going, before it gets too dark.
Old man.
Yes, we're quite lucky.
If you don't hurry up, we're gonna leave you behind.
All right, we're coming.

Episode 25 Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'doul, Part 1
Wh-What's that?
They're here.
It's a helicopter!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
You don't have to state the obvious. We can see that.
That's a helicopter from the Speedwagon Foundation.
They're looking for a place to land.
Speedwagon Foundation?
Your old friends who are taking care of Mom back in Japan?
Yeah, that's right.
Don't tell me we're going for a ride in that helicopter.
No. As much as I'd like to, the crew aren't Stand users.
If we were attacked, they would be at risk.
Then why is that helicopter here?
They've brought us a helper.
What? A helper?
Mr. Joestar!
It's impossible for him to come with us on this trip!
There's no way he could be helpful.
Do you know him, Avdol?
Yeah, very well.
Hold on. If he's a helper, that means he's a Stand user, right?
He's the Stand user whose Stand suggests the card called The Fool.
The Fool?
The Fool?
We're lucky that he's not our enemy.
You wouldn't be able to beat him.
What'd you say, you asshole?
It's the truth.
Sounding all high-and-mighty and shit...
Knock it off already.
The helicopter landed.
Mr. Joestar! Thank goodness you're safe.
Thanks for coming out here. I appreciate it.
So...
Who's the Stand user?
I'm asking which one of you is the Stand user.
Is it you?
No, it's not either of us.
The back seat...
I don't see anyone there.
No, he's there.
Hey, hey, hey!
Is he really short or something?
Get the hell out here! Come on!
W-Watch out!
Hm?
Please, be careful!
The helicopter ride was rough, so he's in a really bad mood.
Don't get close to him!
I told you, he's got some personality issues!
Polnareff, you can't win.
And I'm asking where the hell he is—
Whoa!
H-H-H-H-H-He's...
...a dog!
Don't tell me this dog is....
Yes! He is The Fool Stand's user.
His name is Iggy.
He loves to tear out human hair by the mouthful.
We don't know where he was born.
Avdol was able to find and finally capture him.
Oh, I just remembered.
While he's ripping out hair, he likes to...
fart in the human's face. He's kind of vulgar.
God damn it! You're gonna pay for that!
Damn you...
Chariot!
Th-That's...
So that's The Fool.
We met an orangutan Stand user off the shore of Singapore, but...
Who the hell do you think you are, you stupid mutt?!
Don't make me cut you in half!
Slice
What the?! It's like it's turning into sand...
I-I can't cut it!
Now it became solid and swallowed up my sword!
That's...
Simply put, it's a Stand made of sand.
Yeah... And the simpler they are, the stronger they are.
I'm not sure if I could hit it.
Hey! Help! Do something about this dog!
You monster!
Do you have his treats?
If we didn't, we wouldn't have been able to make it here.
Stop! Help me!
His sense of smell is incredible.
What is that?
Coffee-flavored chewing gum.
Mr. Avdol! Keep the box hidden from—
Oh, no! He got the box!
At least take the paper off first.
There's no way he could actually help us.
Good grief.
Damn it...
You stupid bastard!
While he's eating the gum, he should be fine.
Let's get the supplies out now.
Here's some food and water for your trip.
Oh, thank you.
There are medical supplies and a change of clothes, too.
Also, a new camera, for taking spirit pictures.
TVs don't work so well for spirit photography.
Oh, I know.
I see. It'll make a nice memory.
Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!
But you're already such good friends, Polnareff!
Mr. Joestar, we'll be taking our leave now.
There's something I'd like to ask you.
About my daughter...
How is Holly doing?
Her energy is fading, and her life remains in danger.
she'll be lucky if she survives for another two weeks.
There's no time.
Damn it...
Also, we have some information for you.
According to the report, two days ago...
Nine mysterious men and women
DIO and nine others?
We don't know who they are.
We were unable to locate the nine men and women.
Hold on.
Any remaining Stand users with Stands that
the only card left is The World.
I had thought that The World would be DIO's Stand, but...
Avdol?
I-I don't know.
Apparently, DIO's head hasn't gotten used to its new body yet.
DIO is very proud, so there's no way he'd flee from Cairo.
It would appear that he's trying to stop us from reaching Cairo.
Good grief. There's only two weeks left, and nine of them...
We might end up a little tired.
We'll be off, then.
Please have a safe trip.
Thank you. Take care of Holly.
That dog...
Damn. So close.
The Nile Ue Ue Fly, eh...
It's because of this fly that Joestar and the others
The Fool
Iggy
Mr. Joestar, can't you do something about this?
Why is that shitty little dog sitting in
It's so cramped, my back hurts.
You'll have to wait until the flavor from his
Once that happens, I'll throw a new piece of gum into
Then you can change seats.
All right, all right. Calm down! Damn it...
Wh-What the hell?!
L-Look! Over there!
Th-That's...
The Speedwagon Foundation helicopter that flew off earlier is down in the sand!
There's no sign that it was attacked.
It's like it just fell to the ground.
It couldn't be!
Be careful!
Look! It's the pilot!
He's dead...
There are marks where he clawed the helicopter's side...
This is horrible.
Approach carefully.
It's water.
So much water...
There's even a small fish.
He drowned in the middle of the desert!
What on earth?
H-Hey...
The other one's over here.
He's alive!
Are you all right? Get a hold of yourself!
Water...
What? You want water?
Right.
Here, get a hold of yourself. Here's some water.
Drink slowly.
No! The water's going to attack!
What?!
I-It's the enemy Stand!
The enemy Stand is inside the canteen!
D-Damn it!
The Speedwagon Foundation crew wasn't
Avdol, did you see what kind of Stand it was?
I only saw a hand.
I haven't seen it leave.
Who could it be?
Is the attacker one of them, then?
Jotaro, locate the enemy's body.
I'm looking for it right now.
The enemy's body isn't anywhere I can see.
I even looked for something like that stupid mirror The Sun had.
But it seems the enemy is operating from very far away.
Polnareff, attack the canteen.
Huh? Me...?
Th-The pilot's head was completely sucked into that tiny little canteen.
So if I poke a hole in that thing...
Hell no!
Kakyoin! You're closer!
I don't want to.
Don't try to make someone do something you won't do yourself!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
No means no.
Well, I say that I don't want to do it, either!
Th-This is...
Kakyoin!
It's the water!
It's not that the Stand was inside the canteen...
It got Kakyoin!
I-It got Kakyoin's eyes!
Polnareff! Stop panicking!
Crap. It's going to get Polnareff, too.
What's going on? It attacked the pilot's corpse!
No, not the corpse. The watch.
It attacked the watch's alarm.
Sound! It attacks by locating sounds!
Sounds?
Shit! Polnareff!
Run to the vehicle!
I-It's so fast!
Hurry, Polnareff!
It cut me!
Hermit Purple!
It soaked into the ground...
The enemy can detect sound through vibrations in the ground.
And its user is able to remain far away.
They all got onto their vehicle.
Too bad figuring that out won't do them any good...
H-How's Kakyoin?
It's not good.
Let's drive.
But if we move, it'll attack.
We can't be careless.
What?!
These footsteps... It's the dog.
That dog...
It anticipated my Stand's attack.
It seems that dog is going to be a problem after all.
The tires are in the water! Shit!
It's no use. We're being pulled in!
We're going to slip!
Move further back!
Helper! Come on, damn it! Help, already! Hey!
That accursed dog...
What should I do...
I'll have to take care of the dog first!
How careless can you be?!
No, I'll leave the dog alone.
If it's just going to sleep, it's harmless.
Now, without hesitation...
It's so sharp! It cut the front tires in half!
Go even further back!
S-So that's what it's trying to do... Shit! Everyone hang on!
Rumble

I can hear it! I can hear it!
Don't make a sound.
He can smell where the enemy's going to attack next.
The water started chasing Jotaro!
It's Iggy.

Everyone, hold on!
Oh, no!
The water sank... Everyone, don't move!
No one make a sound!
It's too late to be quiet now.
I know exactly where each of you fell.
Four... Five steps.
I hear it, I hear it.
Now, that must have sounded like walking.
Accursed water Stand! Attack that spot.

Stardust Crusaders
Episode 26 Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'doul, Part 2
Here he comes!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Wait. Why did he take only five steps?
Why hasn't he moved any further?
Now!
Magician's Red!
What?!
Wha—
Avdol!
Who is out there?
S-So strong...
Avdol!
That was a sneaky little plan.
Those weren't footsteps at all.
And this burn...
But I defeated him.
Time to finish you...
...Avdol!
This time, I definitely hear someone running.
You fool! Jotaro, what are you doing?!
Judging from the distance between footsteps, he's about 190...
It's not Joestar. These are a young man's footsteps.
It must be Jotaro.
Jotaro, where are you going?
Hey! It dived!
So that's what he's trying to do.
It won't attack Avdol again, but... Jotaro!
He's going to catch up to you!
If I can dispose of him, I'm sure Lord DIO will be very pleased.
For Lord DIO, I'll give my all to defeat Jotaro.
Jotaro picked up something from the ground just now.
What was at that location?
What was it...
No, it wasn't a thing.
It's the dog! Jotaro picked up the dog.
Good grief, you bastard.
You can tell where the enemy's coming from by the smell, can't you?
Don't stop, Jotaro!
Now, then. You're going to help me out, Iggy.
Where's he going to attack? Tell me, Iggy!
Otherwise, you'll die, too!
You won't get any gum from me, either.
Iggy!
He can float, too?
You're not getting away!
I may be heavy, but don't you dare try to escape alone.
My Star Platinum is incredibly fast.
What? The footsteps disappeared after the jump.
Impossible....
This is good.
Jotaro's going to travel through the air
He's gone...
Why have his footsteps stopped?
He's gradually losing altitude...
Looks like The Fool can't fly very far.
So now it's just gliding, like a paper airplane?
My feet are about to scrape the ground.
Hey, don't strain so much.
It's making you fart.
Don't make us hit the ground.
I guess there's no choice.
I'll have to help you gain height by kicking off the ground.
but the sound of that impact put us at a major disadvantage.
He'll know now that we're traveling through the air.
I see. That dog's Stand...
It can fly.
And it's coming closer...
Toward me!
I must defeat Jotaro before he gets close!
That guy's Stand is chasing after Jotaro!
He must've figured it out from that step.
We have no choice but to entrust this fight
to Jotaro.
It's coming after me.
The enemy probably can't figure out our exact location.
If I can get to the Stand user before I lose altitude, I can win!
I finally found him!
It seems the enemy is a blind man.
S-Sand! Sand is falling on me!
He's spiraling sand into the air...
Not good!
I can hear it... The reflected sound.
I even know how high you are...
Geb
N'doul
Shoot him!
Star Platinum!
One more shot!
Th-This dog...
That dog is trying to save itself!
He's trying to abandon him!
B-Bastard...
You shitty mutt...
You've acquired such a selfish dog as an ally, Jotaro.
This is the end.
Shwoom
Wha—
What? Something was thrown this way!
It's slicing through the wind...
What is it?
It's Iggy.
Come on, now.
This overwhelming power...
Curses! He's going to crash into me!
What kind of person is he? Throwing a dog...
Damn it! I was one blast away from finishing Jotaro...
Damn!
Where? Where is he?
He's not moving...
This must be his plan!
Where are you, Jotaro?
Right here.
I see...
you would have already knocked me out from behind.
I guess I don't need to use this staff to help me listen anymore.
But I'll need this staff to help me get home.
You knocked off my hat. Even the ocean couldn't manage that.
But don't worry. I held back.
Impossible! You just used your own Stand to...
What the hell are you thinking?!
Jotaro, surely you considered interrogating me
is able to read thoughts.
anything that might leave my lord at a disadvantage.
DIO...
Why are you all so loyal to DIO?
Jotaro, I have no fear of death.
The police didn't scare me at all.
I'm sure that dog understands how I felt.
He was the first and only person to make me feel from the bottom of my heart
He was so powerful, deep, large, and beautiful.
And he was the first in this world to acknowledge my worth.
I waited so long to meet him.
I have no fear of death, but...
The evil need an evil savior.
I will tell you one thing.
My name is N'doul.
My Stand represents what could be called the Tarot's origin.
Menacing
He is god of the Earth.
The nine Egyptian gods?!
I'm only going to tell you about my Stand...
DIO, who makes fanatics out of people...
And those who suggest the nine Egyptian gods...?
Hey, hey. No need to be defensive. I'm not mad or anything.
Hey, Iggy. Want a piece of gum?
Knock it off. I'm apologizing, aren't I?
Here.
Good grief. What an annoying dog.
You're in the middle of the desert. Do what you want.
Well, I'll be damned. You picked up my hat for me?
Maybe you're not so bad.
Thanks.
Blob
G-Gum. Y-You shitty little mutt...
You're no ordinary dog.
Hey!
Jotaro! Are you all right?
Good grief.
Oh? Could that be manga?
How unusual!
Would you like a snack?
Tasty Donuts
In exchange, I'll let you use these binoculars.
What's this? The title is .
There's no author credit...
Huh.
These pictures are pretty unique.
It's well-printed, and in full color!
In a certain place, there lived two very close brothers.
My name's Zenyatta.
My name's Mondatta.
Smile Smile
The traveler gave him snacks and let him look through his binoculars.
Mondatta had a very good time.
Peace Eek Eek
Oh, it's 10:30!
But that kind traveler
impaled his throat on an electrical pole and died.
What a strange manga.
And this book itself is pretty weird.
The pages from here on are all blank.
Nothing's been printed...
So it's missing pages.
But it's an oddly realistic and thrilling manga.
I know I may be asking too much, but would you please sell me this book?
Not happening.
What?
My little brother's book is not for sale!
Menacing
Get the hell out of here.
Little brother?
Didn't you hear me?!
Little bro, I told you not to talk to strangers.
There are a lot of bad people in this world.
Everyone! The bus for Aswan is about to depart!
Let's go.
I see...
I guess we can't do much about that.
Ba-bam
Next Episode Preview
We are unstoppable brothers!
Who's there?!
It's me, Polnareff.
Jotaro, what happened to your uniform?
You're acting weird today.
Could it possibly be that you're...
Could it be...
Could it be...
Zenyatta, the predictions are absolute.

The buddy brothers, Zenyatta and Mondatta, took the bus that came four hours later.
So they weren't in the accident. La la!
Trot
Trot Trot
What new adventure awaits the buddy brothers?
As they entered the city of Aswan... "Oh! There they are!"
"The five nasty bad guys are there!"
"They're talking to each other."
They seemed so worried...
It's them.
They drank black tea that was poisoned. Gulp!
B-Brother...
So all we have to do is poison them.
My brother, we are invincible together.
which transforms my face...
They're as good as dead!
We're the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!
Episode 27 Khnum's Zenyatta and Thoth's Mondatta
at this table, where they will drink the poisoned black tea.
Th-The predictions made
by my Stand, the God of Knowledge, Thoth, always come true.
How are those two doing?
so he'll probably be released tomorrow.
But Kakyoin's injuries are serious.
I'm worried.
Sadly, Kakyoin might be out of action for the rest of this trip.
Hey, there are a lot of cafés around here. Let's get a drink and relax.
Great idea. Which one?
My cigarette picked that one.
Welcome.
What would you like?
Let's see... I'd like some black tea.
Same.
All right. Three black teas, then?
No, we'd better not.
Huh?
Listen. We're in Egypt, which is enemy territory.
We have to be more careful than we've been when it comes to poison.
From now on, only drink from bottles or cans.
What? Are you serious?
I am serious.
Hey, forget the black tea. We're going to have cola instead.
Cola?!
Yeah. Something wrong with that?
N-No. Okay. Cola, right?
So three colas, then.
Oh, and we'll take the caps off at the table ourselves.
Also, I want the third, fourth, and fifth colas from the right.
C-Cola with the caps on?!
Was the prediction wrong?
B-Believe! I must believe in my brother!
Brother, the predictions are absolute!
Hey, Manager! This cola isn't cold at all.
Hey, are the colas not cold?
Th-The refrigerator is broken.
You're being too paranoid.
How would he know that we'd come in here?
This city has all these cafés, and I happened to choose this one.
If there were only one café, maybe, but there are plenty.
I'm just saying that being careful can't hurt.
If you're that concerned, then let's change cafés.
We'll go to the one across the street.
All right.
Fire!
Huh?
My café is on fire!
A spark from a cigarette some jackass left in the road got into the trash!
Hey, Manager. We'll take three black teas after all.
W-We won...
Man, to throw a lit cigarette in the trash...
They're drinking it... They're drinking it!
D-D-D-Drink it all down...
Th-They drank it!
Eek! This dog ate my cake!
Who the hell brought a dog in here?!
Iggy!
Whose dog is this?
Hey! Get this dog outta here!
Damn it, Iggy!
Stop, you shitty dog!
Damn it! They even had it in their mouths!
Shit! What's supposed to happen after this?
I-It doesn't say yet...
B-But the prediction wasn't wrong.
Just, Thoth can only see the very near future.
This time...
That's right. We're...
The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!
"Damn that dog! Curses! We failed!"
"We were so close!"
Hup Hup
the brothers passed a man with a very annoying face.
The brothers hated guys who looked like that.
I bet he did something in a past life...
I'm so pissed off all of a sudden. I'll punch him!
Bam
Ugh!
Even though he had done nothing wrong, Zenyatta senselessly punched him!
Eek!
The man with the annoying face panicked!
He accidentally dropped his wallet, which was full of money.
The brothers sure are lucky! Peace!
Idiot.
W-We scored big, Brother.
Ah! B-Brother, it's showing up.
They continued to chase Joestar and the others.
Joestar and the others got in a car
Smile Smile
Zenyatta planted a bomb shaped like an orange in their car.
Jotaro went flying!
Kabam
Th-Th-Th-That prediction is so detailed...
Yes!
Khnum
Zenyatta
Clank
Menacing
Kabam
M-M-My Stand, Thoth, can only see the immediate future.
But once it prints a prediction, there is no way to change it! At all!
Jotaro will definitely explode!
The bomb will detonate three seconds after he sticks his finger in to peel it.
His fate
has been decided!
Who's there?
Wha—
Who's in our car?
It's not Jotaro?
No. Jotaro said he was going straight to the hospital.
C-Crap...
Don't let him get away!
C-Crap! It's Joestar and Polnareff!
Yeah, I know!
Hey, don't hide in there!
Who are you? Come out.
We told you to come out, damn it!
Hurry it up!
Hey, hey, why the panic?
Oh, it's you, Jotaro.
My Stand, Khnum, is a transforming Stand.
I can change my height, weight, and even smell to whatever I want.
I made the hat by transforming my hair!
But what happened?
Huh? Um, uh... Yeah.
I left something in the car, so I came back for it.
My wallet. It was my wallet, yeah.
Good grief.
Jotaro, what happened to your school jacket?
S-School jacket?
Wh-What? What? School jacket?
That's really not a good look on you.
Oh... Right, clothes. School jacket, huh...
I-It's at the cleaners!
I took it to the cleaners, and didn't have any money.
Th-That was a good answer. Yeah!
Huh. I see...
Huh?!
Huh? The car?
I-It can't be...
It can't be... It can't be!
isn't the r-real Jotaro, but... No! M-M-M-Me?!
Impossible!
Nah, a-actually, I think I'm going to walk...
What the hell are you talking about, Jotaro?
From here, it'll be a lot faster to take the car.
Z-Zenyatta!
C-Crap...
I have to get out of this Jotaro disguise as soon as possible.
O-Or I'll be the one who gets blown up!
I-I know! I just have to throw the orange away!
I'll just throw the bomb away
so it can blow up the real Jotaro!
Yes!
There! Now I'm safe!
Hey, it's Iggy! I can't believe he jumped in while we're moving.
He's got an orange in his mouth! Did you steal that, Iggy?
Wha?!
Yow!
"Yow"?
You don't usually make noises like that. You're acting weird.
N-No... Yow. You know, y-yow.
I-I was saying there was a cyow over there...
Jotaro... You're really weird today.
You're not actually...
a fake, are you?
G-Good grief. What the hell are you talking about, Polnareff?
Are we at the hospital yet?
Say, Jotaro. Do that special trick of yours.
Special... trick?
What is he talking about?!
I learned it from you.
You know, this!
Hey, you've gotten better.
O-Oh, that's what you meant.
I'm saved! If that's the trick, while it seems dangerous, I can do it!
Sure! I'll do it. It's easy.
All right! Do the one where you have five in your mouth at once!
F-Five?!
Come on! Hurry up and do it. I wanna see it again.
C-Crap. What the hell kind of weird talent does Jotaro have?!
I-If I can't do it...
Polnareff already looks like he might start to peel the orange bomb at any time!
A-All right, damn it!
I'll do it!
F-Five, right? Five.
Ta-da!
Come on, hurry up!
I'll do this! I'm gonna do this! I just gotta do this, right?!
All right! My secret talent!
O-Ow, hot! Hot!
H-Hot... Hot...
I did it! I did it, damn it!
There! Did you see that?! I did it!
People can do anything when their lives are at stake!
Here.
Last time, you drank some juice without putting the cigarettes out.
Come on.
Aw, you failed.
Jotaro, are you all right? Oh my God!
Brother! Brother! Mondatta! Please make this prediction go away!
Get rid of that page!
Zenyatta! The prediction is absolute!
Hurry up and take off your transformation!
If you undo the transformation, then the real Jotaro will get blown up!
You can do it!
Jotaro, you're acting really weird today.
I-I just... f-feel a bit under the weather...
C-Crap!
K-Knowing them, once they get suspicious, they're going to keep poking at me!
but if I don't, then I'll get killed by the bomb!
Kabam
Good Idea
Th-That's it! I'll just use feeling bad as an excuse.
I'll say that I have a stomach ache, and have them let me out of the car.
Jotaro, the way you have your hands together...
You've got your left thumb on top!
C-Crap! Does the real Jotaro always put his right thumb on top?!
Crap! What am I going to do?!
The way you put your hands together proves that you were a woman in a past life!
My fortune said
Wow, really? I always put my left thumb on top, myself.
Then you were definitely a woman in a past life, Mr. Joestar.
What do you mean, definitely?
It's so stupid!
M-My stomach really is starting to hurt...
Being with these two is going to kill me.
A-All right. I'm going to tell them that my stomach hurts...
Jotaro, let's see who can eat a whole orange faster!
What?!
H-Hey...
Stop, damn it!
Whoa! What are you doing, Jotaro?!
Oh...
Wh-What's wrong, Jotaro?
Oh, it's nothing.
You really are acting weird.
I don't think y-y-you should eat that orange.
Huh? Why?
W-Well, you know... It's the one Iggy picked up.
It could have been in the gutter.
Eat this one instead.
It's not dirty or bruised. It's fine.
Whatever. I'll eat this one, and you try with one of those.
Ow!
H-Hey.
My stomach hurts!
My stomach hurts so bad, I can't stand it!
S-Stop the car! Hurry!
Your stomach hurts?
I can't stand it anymore! Let me out! Let me out!
I'll go behind some rock!
But the hospital's right there...
Just go ahead without me. Seriously, just go on ahead!
Hold it, Jotaro!
Here's some paper.
I...
I did it!
I'm gonna go undo my transformation behind that rock!
An orange that Iggy picked up, huh...
It really could have been in a gutter.
What should I do?
Throw it away?
Yes! Now I can use my Stand Khnum's powers to undo the transformation.
And then I win!
We win!
Ah?
What was that sound?
Don't worry about it. Probably construction or something.
Z-Zenyatta...
We've lost, Mondatta.
No...
N-No! My Thoth hasn't lost yet. I-I will k-kill them myself!
Mondatta...
Don't, Mondatta.
They're not normal. It's impossible.
I made up my mind! I'll do it on my own!
I can do it on my own!
You were always so shy... You've grown, Mondatta.
I'm going to kill them!
What's Thoth's next prediction?
Found you...
Th-They're the ones! They punched me and stole my wallet!
Brother! I'm really scared!
Mondatta didn't have time to get revenge.
But don't give up, Mondatta!
That's just how life is.
Huh?
Well, if it isn't Jotaro.
Hey. Took you long enough.
Long enough?
You got here faster than a car...
What the hell are you two...
Hey, an ambulance.
Looks like someone's hurt.
That's too bad...
Oranges, huh? I was just getting thirsty.
I'm going to have one.
Oh?
That man's clothes...
Do you know him?
Of course we don't.
Now, let's go find out how Avdol and Kakyoin are doing.
Ba-dum-tss
The brothers were taken out of the battle together.
The fight had ended without Jotaro and the others
Ba-dum-tss.

Hey, look, it's a sword.
He's holding a sword.
It won't come out... It won't even budge.
I want to cut you down now, too.
Use me, and kill them.
Come at me with your Anubis Stand.

Have your wounds healed, Avdol?
Yes. But I'm much happier that you'll be all right, Kakyoin.
So I will.
He didn't cut my pupils, so I've been told it will heal soon.
In junior high, one of my classmates was hit by a baseball
but he was fine by the next day.
It was just fluid leaking out of his eyeball.
Seriously?
No!
In a few days, I can take off my bandages. I'll catch up with you then.
We're less than 800 kilometers from DIO's lair in Cairo.
Everyone, please continue on, and be careful.
Hmm, the numbers on this receipt from the hospital... Are they Arabic numbers?
This 0 is actually 5, right? And this dot is actually zero, and this 7 is a 6?
And this wormy-looking one is...
A 4. So, the amount we owe is...
46,350 Egyptian pounds?!
That's expensive!
How cute!
What's with this puppy?
It's so unique.
What in the world? He's chewing gum.
Is he waiting for someone?
He's so well-behaved.
And here I thought he was just waiting outside.
Good grief.
He's a hit with chicks!
I wonder why he's chewing gum.
What a strange puppy.
Um, hello?
Let me give you some advice. You'd best get away from that dog.
but in general, he hates people.
you'll regre—
D-Damn mutt! G-Get off of m—
I-It stinks!
Oh, goodness! It farted!
So cute!
You get along so well.
W-We don't get along at all!
Damn it, Iggy! Get off of me!
We're heading in, you lovebirds.
M-Mr. Joestar?!
Y-Y-You...
You shitty little dog!
Episode 28 Anubis, Part 1
They say the ancient Egyptians always buried their dead
That's why the whole city is on the east side of the Nile.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
All structures built on the west side involve graves and the dead.
But our enemies don't care about east or west.
They'll attack from every direction.
Man, your cow is so lazy. She's pretty strong, though...
Hey, Chaka! Hurry up and walk!
Stop wasting time!
Damn it! He's so worthless. Who the hell do you take after?
The cow and the kid both look just like you!
A sword?
What's it doing here?
Hey, look! It's a sword!
Give it here!
What? Did someone drop it?
Who drops a sword?
This is amazing! It looks pretty expensive.
Hey, maybe the owner's around somewhere.
Maybe it's just some antique that's been lying around.
Should we take it to the cops?
Idiot! We could make a fortune if we sold it.
But I'm the one who found it...
If it's just a replica, it's worthless.
Come on! Hurry up and draw it.
Right!
What's wrong?
I-It won't come out! It won't budge at all!
Give it to me.
Here.
Hold that end.
Right.
I-It's no use. The blade isn't even showing at all!
Let me try, too.
Shut it! If I can't do it, there's no way you could, idiot!
M-My hand!
My hand!
M-My hand! My hand's been cut!
What cut my hand?!
I haven't touched anything but its hilt!
What a creepy sword...
Hey! Let me try to get the sword out, too!
Shut up! If you want to try, then just do it!
I-It came out so easily.
But...
I can hear the blade ringing...
It looks like a Japanese sword!
What an amazing find!
Hey! Give it here! You shouldn't be holding it!
Give it to me!
H-Hey, wha...
What... What did you do?!
I-I don't know...
I-It's not my fault...
What the hell are you doing?! Hurry!
Hurry up and take him to a doctor!
Slice
Th-There's something weird about this sword!
It's like it's got a mind of its own!
Calm down.
Calm down, Chaka.
Nothing at all, Chaka...
Wh-Who are you?
I can hear a voice from somewhere...
My name is Anubis.
You unsheathed me.
You shall become my user...
Yes, you are my user!
You have become an expert...
You are an expert in swordsmanship.
Wield me, and kill!
Both he and Dad deserved to die.
Wh-What? H-Hey, Chaka, stop!
Please stop!
Swoosh
I-Impossible! But the cow's not hurt...!
Kill Joestar! Chop up Polnareff!
Slice Jotaro in half!
You are an expert! A master swordsman!
You are stronger than anyone and can cut anything!
Kom Ombo?
Do we really have time to stop here?
Stop griping.
As long as they let us ride the ferry, we can't complain.
Man, I'm starving! Let's get something to eat.
You're so loud. Here. For now, that'll have to do.
That's for Iggy!
Well, don't worry about it. Just take it.
By the way, where's the restroom?
Let's go look for one.
Hey, mister, over here.
Want some papyrus?
Look, look! It's the real thing!
Papyrus?
I'll sell it cheap.
It's totally the real thing?
You betcha. This piece was made by a famous Egyptian craftsman.
Hm...
This is a fake. If it were real, it wouldn't rip so easily.
I know these things.
Huh?
Where did Mr. Joestar and the others go?
Huh?
Iggy?! Why, you little... Hold it!
Hey! Pay for this!
That stupid dog totally gave me the slip...
Menacing
Hey.
It's unusual, too.
You guys usually don't let us see you, or attack us head-on.
That's pretty manly. I didn't think any of you were like that.
Identify yourself.
My name is Chaka.
"I will take your life"? That's a pretty straightforward line.
You're a tougher, more manly enemy than I thought.
Come at me with that Anubis Stand of yours!
Chariot!
He's got a sword, but...
Something's wrong.
The way he moves... The way he wields the sword, his stance...
He's a complete amateur! But something's not right.
This isn't good.
I should keep my distance.
Anubis
Chaka
Wh-What the hell?
And my shirt isn't cut!
If I hadn't kept my distance, I'd be dead now.
You bastard! Chariot!
Stop hiding, and show yourself!
C-Crap...
What the hell? I lost him.
That Stand can phase through matter to cut its target.
My Chariot is only able to strike at a bit more than a meter, at best...
Damn it. He's got me at a disadvantage.
Attacking me, Polnareff, with a sword and getting a hit in... You've got some nerve.
But this is the end of you and your confidence.
Well, Chakster, how about this?
Bring it on!
All I have to do is stay away from the pillars!
You're not gonna pop up out of the ground at me, are ya?!
What?!
The pillar...
I can do more than just pass through them! I can cut the pillars themselves in half, too!
Die, Polnareff!
Th-That was close.
That's Chariot's secret technique, which not even Jojo knows about.
Launching the blade like that...
I only have one blade. If an opponent dodged that, I'd be unarmed.
Well, I guess he's not dead.
That's strange...
The sword's still in its scabbard.
Did it just slip back in by chance?
it's really beautiful.
I think I'll pull it out more...
Hey, Polnareff. There you are.
You went off by yourself, so we were worried.
What if the enemy attacked you?
Polnareff?
Huh? O-Oh. It's you, Mr. Joestar.
I'm not sure if it's because
I turned around too quick, or because of my wound, but I feel so out of it.
Polnareff, why are you crouching?
What? You've got a sword... Did something happen?
Yeah... A stupid guy decided to attack me.
What? The enemy?!
It's over now.
He said he was the Stand Anubis's user.
He was an expert swordsman, able to phase through objects and cut them.
He was a powerful enemy.
"Of course, he definitely wasn't as strong as me,"
Polnareff thought to himself.
He attacked me with this swor—
Huh?
It's gone?!
Mice! Mice are trying to take the sword!
Hey!
Talk about creepy...
If you're gonna steal, steal some damn cheese!
How strange...
Polnareff!
I'm glad that you're safe, but we should always travel in pairs.
Our enemy won't hesitate to attack anyone who's found alone.
Oh, no! That's our ship's whistle.
Let's hurry back. We're going to Edfu today.
Wait. Hey!
Polnareff...
What are you going to do with that sword?
I'm going to hand it over to the police, since it's clearly a dangerous weapon.
Yes, that would be best.
If you left it in those ruins, you don't know who might pick it up.
It looks valuable, too.
Hey, Iggy! Quiet!
What if we get thrown out?
What the hell is with you today?
I guess I should take care of it now.
Polnareff! I thought we told you not to go off on your own!
I just told you! Jotaro, go with him.
Right.
Hey. Shouldn't we get to the police station?
Oh, come on!
A man's got to look his best, right?
Oh, right.
Hey, Pops, would you put this sword over there?
No matter how you look at it, it's clearly a dangerous weapon.
I was rolling around so much yesterday
that this handsome nice guy got all dirty.
Make me shine, Pops.
Sure.
Ow! Ow...!
Hey, Pops! That razor's dull.
Sharpen that thing!
This ought to be the best part of a haircut!
Good grief. You're such a whiner.
Really? Sorry about that.
Good!
Now it's cutting good and close. Feels nice.
That's so... good to hear.
Très bien! Très bi-e-n!
Right here... underneath your chin, correct?
Right under your chin! Right, Polnareff?!
What?!
It's me, you fool. The Stand that represents Anubis!
Next Episode Preview
Grr, grr!
The sword itself is a Stand!
I won't lose to someone I've faced before!
He's strong...
The more I fight him, the faster his attacks become.
The look in Polnareff's eyes...
I'll have your head!

Right under your chin! Right, Polnareff?
What?!
It's me, you fool. The Stand that suggests Anubis!
Wh-What should I do?
Die!
I'll shave your chin right off!
Wh-What the hell are you?!
Aren't you the owner of this place?
C-Could it be that sword...
and it controls the wielder?
So the guy in Kom Ombo wasn't the user?
Polnareff...
No matter how many times you try, you're still no match for me!
Th-The power in this sword...
After last time, I memorized your Chariot's moves and powers!
I'll never lose to someone I've fought before!
Come on, now.
Come on, you've almost got it.
Episode 29 Anubis, Part 2
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Oh?
Polnareff and Jotaro seem to be taking a while.
Polnareff, what's...
Who is that?
Stay back, Jotaro!
Th-This sword is a Stand.
It'd be pretty dangerous for your Star Platinum to fight it with his bare hands.
And the guy's not the user! He's just a puppet.
N-Not to mention, this Stand's gotten stronger!
You bastard!
Whoa, there.
Does that sting?
Now I've learned just how much punishment you can take, too.
I wonder if you'll be able to withstand this next attack, Polnareff.
Polnareff!
I-It's getting stronger... with every strike!
I-I can't take this. I-I can't hold him back!
Now!
Take this!
What?!
I've learned all of your attack patterns.
Once I've fought an opponent, even if my wielder has changed...
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, ...
I won't lose!
I-It's no use. I don't have a weapon anymore...
C-Crap! Help me out, Jotaro!
Star Platinum!
D-Did it work?
No, not even close.
It took everything I had just to land that punch.
Hey, Khan. Are you all right? Hey...
Shit. This thing is strong.
This is the first combat Stand
Just as I'd expect from Star Platinum. You're as fast as I've heard.
But now I've learned all of those moves.
Menacing
Wh-What's wrong, Khan?
Stay back!
get indoors and hide!
Th-This isn't good, Jotaro.
The more we fight it, the faster it gets.
strongest, and most intense attack yet!
Out of the way, Polnareff.
He's trying to cut me down.
Run, Jotaro!
Die!
H-He caught it?!
I can't believe you caught my blade...
I see. Star Platinum's strength doesn't come from its speed and precision alone.
It's also Jotaro's ability to stay cool under fire.
Yes, I know that now...
Is he dead?
No, he's just unconscious.
Jotaro, don't touch that sword!
Even now, the Stand's evil powers could still be active.
Anyone who touches the drawn blade falls under its spell.
Let's sheathe it, but without touching it.
What should we do?
If it gets drawn again, we'll be in trouble.
This thing's learned about our powers.
We may not be able to beat it again.
How about we toss it in the Nile to lay at the bottom forever?
Forever, huh? That's a good idea!
Hold it! This is the police!
Nice timing. Could you get this guy to a hospital?
I came when someone reported a fight, and I find this!
Why do you have a sword?!
Hand it over!
Hey, stop!
Don't pull it out!
Gwaaang
Polnareff!
Polnareff's e-eyes...
Did he fall under the spell of the cursed sword?
Hey! You drew the sword!
I drew the sword?
Hey, now. Don't you dare lie.
Aren't you an officer of the law?
H-Hey, what are you doing?
You're the one who drew it, aren't you?!
But I've never thought about fighting Polnareff before.
I know I can't hold back if I end up fighting Chariot.
Even if I win, it'll mean killing Polnareff.
Don't forget that I, Anubis, have learned all of Star Platinum's moves.
Someone I've fought before can never, ever hope to defeat me!
Hey, now.
H-His speed... This isn't good!
He's getting faster. I-I can't take much more...
I have to stop the sword!
I'll have to catch it again!
It sped up!
I'll have your head!
Wha—
What tremendous speed and power.
This is the fastest Stand that we've faced.
I-I'm going to lose this fight.
If I don't fight Polnareff with my full strength, I'm going to be killed.
To think you'd escape from a failed blade-catch with a headbutt...
I almost had you. Too bad.
But...
Jotaro.
You're thinking about how you'll die if you don't kill Polnareff, right?
How weak of you. Weak, weak!
I'm going to show you something so amazing, it'll finish you off right here and now.
Can you
Jotaro?!
Silver Chariot plus Anubis: dual-wielding!
Anubis
Khan
This isn't good...
If he gets faster on top of having an extra sword...
Even my Star Platinum...
Jotaro?!
I'll stop him before he kills me!
Star Finger!
My right arm is as light as a feather now.
I see. I guess that was one option...
You look shocked.
Here I go! Undone armor!
You fool! There's no way your "ora ora" can withstand two master Stands' dual swords!
Your chest is wide open!
Stab
I've got you now!
I did it! I won!
Lord DIO! I've taken care of Jotaro!
I, Anubis, have defeated Jotaro!
Yes!
Don't think you'll be able to stop the blade or pull it out.
This cursed sword has already
I'll just push it in farther...
Y-You're going to push it in?
Yeah, that's right!
Indeed I will! Lord DIO will be pleased!
S-Stop. Don't push it any further...
It'll be murder.
I will not stop! I'll push it in and tear your guts to shreds!
Bam
Wh-What?!
I-I'm going to snap! I-I have to pull free!
Stop!
By the way, didn't you say you were going to tear me up?
Crack
That's why I said that if you pushed it in any further, it would be murder.
The sword had stopped moving, so it was easy to target.
Still, that was a strong enemy.
This last move took everything I had.
I'm glad it was enough to defeat him before he could learn it, too.
This is the first time I've ever felt so tired.
I have to hurry and meet up with Avdol and the old man.
Wh-What happened to me?
D-Don't tell me I was being controlled by the cursed sword...
Yeah... But it's over now.
Sorry...
Polnareff, get the old man and Avdol.
I'm too tired to walk.
It's shining...
And now I've learned it...
The true user of Anubis was the blacksmith
This means that I am a Stand with no user.
Lord DIO pulled me out of the darkness of a museum storeroom.
Lord DIO's Stand, The World, is a powerful Stand that I could never hope to defeat.
That's why I swore my loyalty to him.
Jotaro, no matter what, I'll kill you!
Sparkle
I've learned all of your powers.
My ultimate speed...
Here's a band-aid.
You'll never see it coming!
I don't want it.
I'll stab you in the back!
Die, Jotaro!
Wh-What?!
Shit! I missed! I tripped on that dog!
Where did that dog come from?!
Hey, it's Iggy.
Eating that right off the ground... What a filthy mutt.
Th-That river is...
The Nile River!
N-No, this can't be real!
At this rate, I'm going to fall in the river!
If I fall into the river, I'm done for! I'll rust away!
Someone stop me!
Yes! On this air current, I'll hit that wall and stop!
Lucky!
What?!
Shit! I was so panicked, I accidentally used my power to phase through the wall!
I'm going to fall!
Yes! A boat appeared! I'm saved!
Then, I'll take over his mind!
Once I control the boatman, I'll begin my counterattack on Jotaro!
Ack! A cow was on the boat!
W-Wait! Stop struggling! Hey!
Calm down, you stupid cow!
I know! I'll take over the cow's mind!
And then...
I won't make it in time!
Hey, look. That cow over there's freaking out about something.
Good grief. Who cares? Just go get the old man and Avdol.
Help!
H-Hey, fishies. Come here a sec.
Come on, touch me.
Hey, wait! Where are you going?
Hey, Mr. Crab.
Come on, take me up to the surface.
I'll give you something good to eat.
Wait! Don't leave me, Mr. Crab!
I'll be rusted through in couple of days!
H-Help me!
Don't leave me!
I'm so alone!
Anubis
Anubis Retires
Stupid mutt.
What are you looking at?
There's nothing to eat over there.
Wha—
I-It stinks!
What the hell do you eat to make your farts smell like this?!
Polnareff...
To think, all of that happened without us.
The Anubis Stand, huh... That must have been rough, Jotaro.
Yeah...
Stop! Get off of me!
I'm never going anywhere with him again.
Stop it already, you stupid mutt!
Star Platinum
Jotaro Kujo
Though they may all look similar to tourists, there are many races that live in Egypt.
wearing a garment called a jellabiya.
This man is a Nubian.
This is a Bedouin, a man of the desert.
This is an Indian, who has nothing to do with this.
And this doesn't have much to do with race, but...
Hey! That chick's legs are smokin'! So hot!
I can't keep my eyes off of her.
Like, bam! They pull you right in!

There is something wrong!

Pardon us.
How are you feeling, Mr. Kakyoin?
I've never been without my vision before, so it's a bit unsettling.
Does it hurt?
Not much. I think the painkillers are working.
I see. That's good.
Hello, Mr. Kakyoin.
Doctor, when do you think I can take off these bandages?
I don't have any time to waste.
I'm afraid we won't be able to discharge you anytime soon.
To be honest, I can't even give you an estimate.
Just kidding!
It's true that you'll need time to heal.
They asked that we put you in their care.
So exactly who are you, anyway?
The Speedwagon Foundation is world-famous.
I don't think they'd get involved with an ordinary high school student.
I have an acquaintance who's very reliable, that's all.
Thank you, Mr. Joestar.
I might be able to join you sooner than I expected.
Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy...
Please wait for me.
Episode 30 Bastet's Mariah, Part 1
This is Luxor, a city about halfway up the Nile.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
In ancient times, it was called Thebes.
This is the Valley of the Kings.
The tomb of the famous King Tutankhamun lies in the Valley of the Kings.
Wow, so this place is pretty historical.
Apparently, there are still people who
I wonder if there are still any tombs or treasures left to be found.
There may be.
By the way, where did the old man go?
To the bathroom.
Bathroom?
Do you need to go, too?
If it's a bathroom, sure.
Oh my God!
The air's so dry, the poop turns into dust and flies away.
So instead of using water, this toilet uses the wind?
And there's no paper.
This is...
Could this be a sand washlet?!
Desert sand is sterile.
Oh my God!
I'm not Polnareff, but I think I'll wait until we're at the hotel.
With a bathroom like that, I might as well just go behind a rock.
That's a strange sight to see in Egypt.
This makes no sense.
What would you even use it for?
It's not like it could be wired to anything.
I-It shocked me...
Mr. Joestar, what's the matter?
Huh? R-Right...
Got it. I'll be right there.
But what a surprise that was...
does that mean they have electricity around here?
What a strange place.
How surreal...
Her card represents the Goddess Bastet. The user's name is Mariah.

We could make it to Cairo in two days, but we're all injured.
Why don't we spend tonight and tomorrow in Luxor to take a break?
We've just barely been winning.
Hey, Mr. Joestar, is something wrong?
My prosthetic hand's been acting up.
Well, I'm sure the joints just need oiling.
Hey! Isn't that radio broken?
How strange. It's made in Japan, and I just bought it...
That static's irritating! Could you turn it off?
Mr. Joestar?
Yeah, I agree. We should probably rest up before we enter Cairo.
But we cannot let our guard down.
All right. Let's find a hotel.
How strange.
Thanks, old man.
Ah, thank you!
Hey, the radio suddenly works.
Huh? That's weird... My hammer's so heavy...
Wh-What?!
Th-The nails... The nails! It hurts...
What? Did you hit your fingers? Be more careful!
Slamming that hammer around is dangerous.
For crying out loud...
Mr. Joestar...
Mr. Joestar, please wake up.
Hey, hurry up!
Polnareff is fussing about getting breakfast somewhere.
Hurry and wake him up, Avdol!
Most old people wake up early in the morning.
Damn it. What a rude little shit...
Right.
Did my watch stop?
But you know, Mr. Joestar...
For a man of your age, your sleeping habits are quite amazing.
You've turned a full 180 degrees.
You fell asleep facing south, but now you're facing north.
Perhaps that proves you're still young?
I'll be waiting downstairs.
Something strange has been going on since last night...
And my prosthetic hand's still acting up.
Wh-What's wrong with this chair?! It's moving on its own!
Could it be that the whole floor isn't level?
This was a pricey hotel, but it must have been built on the cheap.
Where should we go today?
The Karnak Temple was amazing, so I'd say something like that.
It's a bit far, but how about the Valley of the Queens?
What the hell are you doing, you dirty old man?!
Pervert!
I-I have no idea what's going on...
Flip
Oh, my. What a forward, aggressive approach.
You're j-u-s-t my t-y-p-e...
Smooch!
Oh my God!
Something strange is going on! Something strange!
What?!
Th-This is...
Th-They're sticking to me...
All of this metal is sticking to me...
Steel is fixing itself to my body!
Could it be that my body...
My body...
Has it turned into a magnet?!
Ow!
Th-This magnetism... Could it be a new Stand?
But why? Why can't I see the Stand?
Why are the knives and forks flying at me without a Stand around?
C-Could it be...
I-I can't get loose...
O-Oh, no! The escalator is made of steel!
And the magnetism is getting stronger by the minute!
What?!
H-Hey, you! The lady in the miniskirt!
This is trouble!
Push the emergency stop button at the bottom of the escalator!
H-Hey, are you listening?
Enjoy, Joseph Joestar.
Wh-What?! D-Don't tell me you...
You're the Stand user?!
Bastet
Mariah
D-Don't tell me you...
You're the Stand user?!
Rumble Rumble
S-Someone! Someone stop this escalator!
I-I know!
I'll push the emergency stop button...
With my Hermit Purple!
Y-You're kidding! It's not there?!
I-Impossible! This escalator
doesn't have a button?!
I'm getting pulled in!
My neck! My neck!
It's gonna cut my head off!
This is the end!
It's gonna cut my head off!
Ahem. Ahem!
This is the end! I'm going to die!
Mr. Joestar. Ahem! Hello, Mr. Joestar.
Gonna be chopped right off!
Ahem.
The escalator has stopped.
I pushed the emergency stop button.
It was on the side.
No problems!
The stop button works just fine!
Hey, are you from the hotel?
Could you sign off on the inspection? Right here.
What are you talking about, Mr. Joestar?!
The enemy. I'm under the spell of an enemy Stand.
My body is like a magnet now...
She turned me into a magnet! Steel sticks to me!
Pull this thing off me!
And the magnetic force keeps getting stronger...
It's her! That woman is the user!
What?
Catch that woman!
Let's go get Jotaro and Polnareff! They're waiting outside.
What?!
Grab
This... It's heavy...
Avdol?!
We can't wait on Jotaro and Polnareff!
That woman's going to escape.
Mr. Joestar, don't stay! Go!
I'll at least get a look at her face!
Th-This is...
Sh-She went into the women's restroom.
I'm going in.
Mr. Joestar?!
The old man's not here yet?
Yeah. Avdol went to get him, and he's not back, either...
Could it be...
They secretly...
went to eat something super-delicious without us?!
He's just taking his time in the restroom.
If they don't show up in the next five minutes, we'll go look for them.
Oh, right. Restroom. Yeah, that's possible...
Come to think of it, the toilets in this hotel were so clean...
Mr. Joestar, it's good that we came in here...
But as I expected, most of the stalls are in use.
Shh!
Oh, shh...
Sorry. But I-I don't know... Which one is she in?
She has amazing legs.
H-Her legs?
Yes! Look for those legs!
W-We're going to look in?
That's not it.
Or these...
Nope.
Menacing
M-Mr. Joestar, right here!
Come here! Are these her legs?
Bam
Oh, my. You're the wonderful man I met earlier.
You came all the way here this time?
What a bold approach...
Holy shit!
It's that old hag! But she was upstairs!
Th-This isn't good!
How could you screw that up?!
Avdol, run!
Wai—
Perverts!
This is not in line with my image!
Bathroom disaster is Polnareff's thing!
It's a peeping old man!
How awful!
You perverts!
No, you're wonderful!
She's headed that way!
Damn it. When did she get over there?!
Don't touch it, no matter where it is!
That's the enemy's Stand!
I'm afraid I've touched it, Mr. Joestar.
What?! Wh-Where?!
When I pushed the emergency stop button at the escalator...
There was an outlet nearby, and it shocked me.
Th-That woman...
M-Mr. Joestar, please don't run so close to me.
It's hard to move with you stuck to me.
Y-You get away, Avdol!
What are you talking about? You're the one getting closer!
will attract each other!
To think that my body, too, would become a magnet...
Mr. Joestar, this situation...
Yeah, it's extremely bad.
Th-This enemy...
This enemy...
She's strong!
Next Episode Preview
My body, too, became a magnet...
We can't help it! We're both in her power now.
What a strong woman!
What should we do? At this rate...
I've never backed down from a fight!
I'm just going...

She went around the corner! After her!
Stuck
This is absurd! I can't believe my body's become a magnet, too!
Calm down, Avdol!
Just think about fighting and defeating her Stand!
Where did that woman go?! Damn it!
I don't see her.
Anyway, we can't stay here like this forever.
Understood.
We managed to stand up.
Let's go to that fence, grab hold, and pull apart.
Here we go, Avdol. Use your core muscles!
Get a rhythm going!
Right, Mr. Joestar.
One! Two!
One, two.
One! Two!
One, two.
One! Two!
One, two.
Ah...
M-Mr. Joestar... Th-This is very embarrassing.
Hey! What are you looking at?
Y-Yes, dancing outside is truly the best!
Go away, damn it!
All right. Just a little more, Avdol.
One, two, and...
We did it! We made it this far without tripping.
I-Indeed...
Avdol, do you think you can slowly slide off of me?
Yes, I think I can.
All right...
I'll hold on to this fence.
Positive
Positive
Negative
Negative
R-Right...
Y-Yes, just like that.
Wh-What's wrong, Avdol?
Th-This position...
Doesn't this look very risqué?
N-No one's looking! Hurry up and slide free!
They brought even more friends!
H-Hey! Go away! Stop looking at us!
Hey! I said go away, you damn brats!
That's easier said than done...
This is not the role I've taken! I swear it isn't!
Fine, then I'll move!
M-Mr. Joestar, slow down!
Stick
Mr. Joestar, if you move like that...
I-It's the old lady from the hotel!
How dare you play with a woman's heart?!
You cheater!
Hurry! Hurry, Avdol! I'm starting to cry!
You villain!
Help me! Oh my God!
Wait... This is a misunderstanding!
We did it!
We need to stay apart, Avdol!
Your magnetism is growing stronger and stronger.
Curse you, damned fool! Go to hell!
There she is. It's that woman.
She's got some nerve, just sitting there and smoking.
Avdol, approach her from that side.
Don't let her get away this time.
She seems like a strong woman.
N-No, Mr. Joestar...
Bam
A railroad track!
M-My foot is stuck!
A-Again...
...we're...
...stuck together!
Son of a bi—
What is it, Mr. Joestar?
This sound... O-Oh, no! We can't stay here!
Avdol, use Magician's Red's flames to slice the rails!
B-But, Mr. Joestar...
It's coming! The train's coming! Hurry up and slice the rails!
I-I can't. If I were to slice these rails...
The train would derail, causing a huge accident and killing many people!
That woman... How dare she...
Even if I tried to grab her with my vines, she's out of my Stand's range.
But I can try using that post to pull us free...
I-It's no use! The magnetism's gotten stronger.
Mr. Joestar, keep pulling! You can do it!
I-It's coming! Pull harder!
What?!
Ker-thump
I've won.
Bast
Mariah
I've won, Lord DIO!
Now to kill Jotaro and Polnareff!
Good thinking, Avdol! You burned through the railroad ties and dug a hole!
This is it! This!
This is the role my character plays!
C-Clever little bastard...
You...
Magician's Red!
Swoosh
Hermit Purple!
Grab
I've got you!
Now, young lady...
Your magnetism is rather troublesome, you know.
Boom
Boom
What are you imagining? My chest didn't get bigger...
Your magnetism just got stronger.
This is what I had in my pockets.
The weapons I had in my pockets!
Mr. Joestar, duck!
Magician's Red!
Your magnetic force will keep growing stronger...
She's getting away!
No, she's not escaping.
She's keeping a certain distance between us.
I'm sure that woman fights by staying neither too close nor too far.
If she gets too close to us, she'll be caught.
This magnetism is the work of a Stand, so it follows the rules of Stands.
What shall we do?
Shall we flee until the magnetic force expires?
but I've never once abandoned a fight.
I'm going to keep fighting with all my might!
This is a map of the city. Right now, we're here.
If she continues down this road, she'll loop around and head back this way.
We'll split up
and catch the woman here.
I won't think of her as a woman anymore.
I'll get her, no matter what!
After her!
Hey, look.
The rails have been cut...
People from the city have arrived.
Let's go!
Seems like something's going on.
Someone cut the rail line!
Will the trains be okay?
They've stopped running for now.
Someone cut the rail line?
Why would someone do that? Are they stupid?
You know, Jotaro...
I think people like that will get what they deserve.
I spent three months' pay on this.
Let's get married!
Oh, my...
Huh? Wait, what?!
Huh?
They're chasing as fast as they can...
B-But they'll never catch me.
Stay calm. Gotta stay calm...
Looks like you can barely move now.
You won't be able to chase me anymore.
You think so?
It's a pincer attack!
A pincer attack?
You think you've cornered me, but it's you two who are cornered.
Look above you!
High voltage power lines!
Crap! Power lines are...
That's right. Power lines are magnetic.
You'll burn to a crisp!
Magician's Red!
Hermit Purple!
My Bast's power is far greater
Woman, my flames will roast you!
Something's pulling me! My whole body's being pulled!
My body is being crushed!
I can't keep this up!
Joseph Joestar, since this is the end, I'll tell you...
You were quite amazing.
and your experience gives you the good judgment that young people lack.
You've got very charming looks, too.
Our ages are quite far apart, but I might not have minded being with you.
Th-That's great...
Would you mind saving me, then?
Hmm...
You're a lot more powerful than my Hermit Purple!
I can't hold on much longer... P-Please. Stop the magnetism!
Well...
Nah, I don't think so.
You're nowhere near as charming as Lord DIO.
I-Is there nothing that will convince you to stop the magnetism?
No, not happening. Sorry, but you have to die.
Even though I'm begging you?
You're much too persistent, you fool.
Then you've lost, young lady.
What?!
Sh-Shi—
Crash
We told you this was a pincer attack!
Magnets are attracted to each other.
Once you were between us, your luck ran out.
She can't hear you, Mr. Joestar. It looks like she's passed out.
She's been crushed by the weight and magnetic force.
I'm sure she's broken more than a few bones.
Now, then... Shall we go get some breakfast?
Certainly. I'm rather hungry after all that running around.
It's already 9:00 AM.

Here you are, ma'am.
Enjoy.
Oh, it looks so good.
Gulp, gulp, gulp.
My, you drank that down so quickly this early in the morning.
It's fine.
Now, have some cake.
Why, thank you. Don't mind if I do.
Kids are so innocent.
It's almost 9:00 AM...
The old man and Avdol are pretty late.
They might have encountered an enemy.
Maybe we should go look for them.
Yeah. Good grief.
Come on, Iggy.
I know, I know. You're hungry, right?
So am I.
Hey, where are you going?
Damn it, you stupid mutt.
Let's go.
Hey!
Let me play with you guys, too.
You're too picky, so no.
Don't be like tha—
Ow...
Menacing
You didn't cry, little boy.
Very good. Are you hurt?
How old are you, little boy?
Four, eh? Hmm...
Very good. What's your daddy doing right now?
Working.
So your daddy's away at work? Very good.
How about your mommy?
She's at home doing laundry.
Very good.
So you're here playing by yourself?
Yeah...
Then I guess I can smack you for getting mud on my pants!
Are you going to pay for this?
How many years am I supposed to wait
You stupid little brat.
Mommy!
Hmph.
Mariah is fighting with Joestar and Avdol.
I, Alessi, shall kill Jotaro and Polnareff.
They are strong!
Very good, me.
This man's name is Alessi.
He has a habit of saying, "Very good."
Polnareff, don't let your guard down.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Mr. Joestar and Avdol aren't here.
It doesn't look like anything happened, either.
Old man. Avdol. Are you here?
Jotaro.
I'm starting to get suspicious.
Yeah.
That looks so good.
Give me a bite.
Okay, sure.
Huh?!
My kebab sandwich! Wait! G-Give it back!
You thieving dog!
A pincer attack?
You still don't get it.
You think you've cornered me, but it's you two who are cornered.
You'll burn to a crisp!
Magician's Red!
Hermit Purple!
but you have no chance, Joestar.
My Bast's power is far greater than your Hermit Purple's!
Menacing
Stare
U-Um... U-Uh... I dropped some change...
Where can it be...
Hey... Why are you following us around, glaring at us all the while?
I sense murderous intent in you.
Huh?
W-Were you talking to me?
Wh-What are you talking about?
I got these eyes from my parents. They can't be murderous...
I found the coin I dropped.
Oh? Then I guess I'll just have to find out
if you're a Stand user or not...
Myself!
Th-That was close...
So you are a Stand user!
Zuwooo
You're running?!
Hey, Jotaro! There's an enemy!
An enemy appeared!
Polnareff...
Where are you, Polnareff?
Jotaro, over here!
Come back here, you!
Wait!
What the hell?! He's fast! Why the hell is he so fast?!
He got so far already...
Huh? My voice... Whoa!
Ow!
Wh-What? My shoes... They're huge!
Hey, that's dangerous.
If you run around in the road like that, you'll get hit by a car.
Good thing I wasn't a car.
Shut up, you dumbass!
Move, you moron! I'm running after someone!
What the hell are you doing?! W-Wait, what?!
What?! I'm super-high up!
Th-This guy lifted me up with one hand!
His face and hands are huge!
Hey, watch your mouth, brat!
Look at your baggy clothes. Were you trying to be an adult?
Talk about a snotty-looking little brat...
What? What the hell?!
Move it, kid! You're in the way!
Wh-What is going on?!
What?!
Wh-Wh-What?
I'm a kid?!
Th-This is really me... I've turned into a kid!
Set
Alessi
C-Could this really be...
Is this kid really...
Me?! I-I-I'm a kid!
I turned into a kid!
You're kidding! No way! No way!
Th-That guy's Stand...
That creepy guy's shadow-like Stand...
When his shadow touched mine, he used his power on me.
Wh-What the hell?
Jo—
Jo...
Jo... n-no, Jay, Jackie, J-J...
Wh-What was his name? I can't remember!
He'd be able to help me... S-So why?
Why can't I remember?!
Hey, kid. Did you see a French guy pass by?
He's about this tall, and he's got a similar hairstyle to yours.
Th-That's me! Me! Me!
Good grief... Asking a kid was a mistake.
W-Wait!
Menacing
When your body becomes a child's, that means your mind
Your memory will begin reverting to your childhood.
I'm going to forget things I knew when I was an adult?
It's true... It's already fading...
Has the time come?
I love picking on the weak!
Very good, me!
Whoa, there! I'm not letting you get away, brat.
I can't help but think I'm pretty messed up, honestly.
But you know what they say...
So I'm not weird, right?
Mister guy whose name I don't know, hel—
So you see, my mission is to dispose of you.
I'm stuck! It won't come off!
Sadly...
I don't have time to pick on you.
That's Silver Chariot, huh?
Well, I guess it's possible for you to use the Stand you had as a child.
But...
Pami! Pami!
A-And he's super weak! His sword's even bent!
your mental power has reverted to a child's, as well.
That is, your Stand has also reverted to childhood.
Just like your days as an undeveloped child.
Do you understand?
Apparently you do. Very good.
Still, even if it's weak, you can still use your Stand.
So I'm afraid I must kill you with my own Stand.
Die, Polnareff!
You're mine!
Oh, no!
It snapped!
Huh?
S-Serves you right! I meant to do that!
Ow! Ow! It hurts!
Are you okay, little boy?
H-He's gone!
It saved me this time, but it's still pretty scary.
Wait, little boy.
You're hurt! What happened?
Huh? Uh... Um, uh...
What are you mumbling about?
Huh?!
We have to treat your wounds. I'll fix you up at my house. Come on.
I-I guess I'll go.
Come on, now.
Whoa...
Oh, right.
You're hurt. Here, grab on.
She smells nice...
It hurts!
D-Damn it!
Like hell I'm gonna keep quiet after a kid makes a fool of me.
For my pride as an adult, I'll beat him to death!
Th-That guy... He doesn't seem to be coming after me.
All right, little boy.
Huh?!
You're covered in dirt. I'll wash and treat your wounds.
What are you just standing there for?
Oh, all right.
I'll take them off for you. Here, raise your leg.
This isn't... This isn't...
What's wrong?
N-Nothing.
No, it's something!
It's definitely something!
I don't understand why, but it feels like this should be really embarrassing...
And, and, and...
It's so small!
Now, grab onto my body.
Huh?
I-I-I-I'm so happy! Seriously? Seriously, is this really okay?!
Is it okay? Of course. If we don't, you're going to get an infection.
Oh, your wee-wee's got dirt on it, too.
but I'm a kid, so I can't tell what!
All right, be a good boy, okay?
Okay!
You little shit...
I'll cut you in half, then tear you to pieces!
What are you smirking for?
All right. Let's wash your hair.
Huh? No! No, no, no, no, no...
I hate shampoo!
It burns my eyes! I hate it!
Rock, paper...
Scissors.
Monkey, monkey, monkey...
Monkey do, monkey do...
Agh! I lost!
Now, sit down.
Does it sting?
Yeah, it stings.
Can you wash it by yourself, then?
Uh-huh, I can.
Oh? Very good.
Menacing
Bam
Let me say it again.
Very good!
N-No way!

If it stings that bad...
Make sure you wash it all off!
Very thoroughly!
Since I'm a kid, my arms aren't long enough!

About five to ten minutes, perhaps?
You must be in despair!
I'll put an end to you right now.
This is what it means to be utterly helpless, Polnareff.
Ploop
Wh-What is this?
This shape... This color! It can't be...

Polnareff, you noticed the attack in an instant and managed
so she reverted to a fetus.
She's going through this because she tried to take care of you.
How stupid.
Y-You scum!
C-Crap! I just...
Whoa!
You touched it again!
I'd say you're going to be around four years old this time, Polnareff.
Crap!
I-I have to...
I have to hurry up and beat him, or the lady will...
At this rate, the lady will die in a matter of minutes.
I have to do something to beat that old creeper as soon as I can!
She treated my wounds and was so nice to me...
I have to...
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Why are you running around cradling that dying fetus?
I'll just do the same to you!
C-Crap! I just touched the shadow again!
M-My body's shrinking...
Yahoo!
Yes! Now I've achieved total victory!
Polnareff! You must be about three years old now.
Your mind will soon revert to a three-years-old's, too.
Locking the door won't do any good!
Damn it! The bars are too close together.
Even if I'm a kid...
I won't be able to get out through the window.
Damn it!
I-I can't cut them...
Looks like your precious Chariot's about three years old now, too.
and he's so slow!
I'm coming in now!
Lick, lick, lick, lickity-lick!
I'm coming in, Polnareff.
Silence
H-He's not here?
He's not here! That little punk...
Did he manage to somehow squeeze through these bars and go outside?
Whoa, that was close!
That bastard Polnareff is trying to trick me.
but he's probably hiding somewhere nearby, waiting to get the drop on me.
Not bad.
Where are you hiding...
At his small size, he could probably fit in that drawer.
He's probably hiding in the bucket or the drawer...
No, he could even be in the stuffed animal.
Which one are you in? I've got a one-in-three chance.
I'll try to get it on my first guess.
I'll smash this axe into your brain on my first try!
That stuffed animal looks the most suspicious!
and then I go for the clock that I hadn't mentioned yet!
I-I was wrong!
Then...
The simple choice! Let's go for the bucket!
Huh?
So it the stuffed animal!
Th-Th-The drawer, then!
H-He's not here!
He's not here! Not here! Not here! Not here!
Not here! Not here! Not here!
I-Impossible! He's not here!
The walls and ceiling are made of stone.
Even if they were one centimeter thick, that Chariot couldn't dig through.
And I know he wouldn't be able to make it through the bars.
Impossible! Where is he? Where did he go?
You're going to lose to a kid in a battle of wits?
Gulp!
Old Man Alessi.
I-Impossible!
A-A goldfish disappeared...
Set
Alessi
I was in the goldfish tank, using the mirror!

Old Man Alessi, you stupid creeper!
Even if he's only two, Chariot can still cut up your face!
Not good! Not good at all!
H-Hey, wait!
Pami!
I'll keep attacking with my Stand until he gets too young to use!
Not good! Not good at all!
Not good !
That asshole! He escaped out the window!
Not good! Not good at all!
Doom
Jotaro!
Crap! He's going to kill me!
It's not very normal to come falling out a window all bloody.
Calm down... Calm down, me.
At times like this, the one who stays calm wins.
and doesn't know about me.
I'll just play dumb like I usually do...
And then attack!
Ah!
Ah! The owner of this house is going to be so mad at me!
I was cleaning the window and slipped!
What am I going to do? What am I going to do?
He's going to be so mad!
Hold it, you shitty old man!
Ah!
Mister...
Who were you again? Who were you...? Um, um...
Now! I was waiting for Polnareff to show his face!
You're wide open, Jotaro!
Duwaaah
Ah! Don't touch his shadow!
Yes! I touched it! I touched Jotaro's shadow!
Crap!
Jotaro! You've fallen under my Set's spell, too!
Th-This... Wha—
Th-This is..
O-Oh, no!
That guy's going to turn into a kid, too!
Jotaro!
Which means you weren't able to use your Stand as a child!
You're just going to turn into a normal kid!
He's becoming so small!
He turned into a seven-year-old!
I've won! Lord DIO, I will be the one who kills Jotaro!
You're going to pay me royally for this!
Die, Jotaro!
Whoa! He punched him! With his little kid fist!
Good grief.
E-Even as a child, when Jotaro's serious...
...he's really serious! He's so strong...
Mumble, mumble, mumble... Huh?
Bam
Not good enough. Time to make doubly sure he's finished!
Very good!

Was that all a dream?
That boy was wearing this...
It really happened.
For some reason, my body couldn't move...
That's right! I couldn't move a muscle, but I remember.
That boy was trying his best to protect me...
Where did that very brave and manly boy go?
Where did my little knight go?
Where are you? Where did you go?
She was such a nice and wonderful lady.
She was so genuinely kind.
That was close...
Um, pardon me...
Did you happen to see a little boy leave my house?
He has silver hair, just like you.
Pardon me for asking, but have we met before?
N-No... I-I didn't see any kid.
L-Let's go, Jotaro.
Come on, hurry up.
Ah...
W-Wait!
That earring...
We've never met before.
There's no way we could have.
The two of us are travelers.
This is the first time I've been here, and I already have to get going
to the next town.
So it must have been a dream after all.
Don't say anything, Jotaro.
Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!
Where have you two been?
Ah, Mr. Joestar and Avdol!
I told you two not to wander off on your own.
Look who's talking! You're the ones who disappeared!
Now, now. Let's go get something to eat.
Iggy! Where the hell were you?
Silver Chariot
Jean Pierre Polnareff
Let me clear that away for you.
Thanks.
Finally, we can relax a little.
What should have been our breakfast became lunch.
Yeah...
We're almost to Cairo.
We've got to figure out where DIO is hiding.
Oh, a spirit photo!
Will it show up?
I'm not sure. But we've gotten close, so it should be quite accurate.
All right, here we go!
Wham
Sir, is something the matter?
Nothing. Just go back over there.
Y-Yes, sir...
Well, old man? Can you see anything?
Just a little longer.
There!
This is the place we have to find!
Bam

You're the one who fell for the scam.

Episode 34
Darby the Gambler, Part 1
Good.
Hamon will travel even better down here!
Underwater...
Turquoise Blue Overdrive!
Jo--
JoJo!
H-He did it!
It's not over!
I can't believe he outswam Hamon traveling underwater!
He's like lightning. My Overdrive only scraped his head.
It'll take a solid punch to send Hamon directly into him!
Lord Dio!
I thank you for giving me life and the supreme honor of fighting this man!
He is made of the stuff of heroes.
Now we fight without the burden of water!
Now we face each other using skill, technique and spirit alone!
Hold nothing back! Show me everything you have!
Even as Dio's puppet, he hasn't lost his pride!
But it has been twisted into a love of violence!
Your blood will be one with my body!
Another hair attack?!
Bring it! I'll give you a dose of Hamon!
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 6: Tomorrow's Pluck
Overdrive Barrage!
JoJo!
T-This is bad. Hamon can only be projected from the extremities!
He can't cut Blueford's hair with his arms tied up like that!
I-I want to help him, but we have our own problem!
Tarukus! H-He's gonna...
I-It's tearing through my clothes and into my skin!
Struggling only makes it worse!
His hair is draining my blood!
Here's your coup de grace, pup!
I'll slice off your head and bathe in a fountain of blood!
Try this instead!
Metal conducts Hamon, too!
Metal Silver Overdrive!
G-Good show!
He turned blocking the sword into an attack using Hamon!
My heart resonates...
Heat enough to burn...
My blood's beat is razor-sharp!
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
Yes! There's the sound of flowing Hamon I'm so used to!
S-Something is different about Blueford.
Now that I know his past and personality...
This is for the best.
He has to be destroyed.
I am the Black Knight Blueford.
This pain is nothing to me!
You're a mess, Blueford!
I can't believe his bloodlust still drives him in that state!
What?! What are you doing, Jonathan?!
Dodge or counter! Why aren't you moving?!
What in blazes?
What are they thinking?
You said this pain just now.
Pain.
You feel pain.
T-The flowers!
They're blooming at his feet.
Black Knight Blueford's body is being ravaged by Hamon.
But pain has returned to him.
The pain of being human.
As Hamon destroys his zombie form, it is restoring his noble human soul.
That's why I stopped fighting you.
And that's why you stopped your sword.
His face is no longer twisted by rage and hatred!
He looks like a son peacefully talking with his mother!
You believed I would stop my attack.
Your trust kept you from counterattacking.
Is your faith in humans so strong?
This pain means I'm alive.
If I can feel pain, I can feel joy as well.
This is humanity.
I am filled with an odd tranquility.
I feel no bitterness.
Here, at the end, I have met a marvelous man of true compassion.
I shall now return to my queen.
Jonathan Joestar.
Jonathan, I grant you the word engraved
Luck.
And for your future, I grant you this:
Pluck!
Sir Blueford!
What irony.
What a twisted fate.
Why did I have to kill him in order to save his soul?
He left the world with hate, but he had a proud spirit.
His noble heart was bent to terrible insanity!
The mask caused this!
And I'll stop Dio, the man behind it!
JoJo! Behind you!
Tarukus!
W-What the...?!
How could he heartlessly stomp the armor
Blueford, you spineless dog!
I admired him, but cunning was his game...
...while I chose to be a master of slaughter!
I crush, kill and destroy using brute force alone!
Let me hear your anguished cries!
Nice catch, JoJo!
The cliff is crumbling!
These leaves...
JoJo!
Yes, sir!
Life Magnetism Overdrive!
Grab on, Speedwagon, Poco!
Humans create a weak magnetic field, making them living magnets.
An Overdrive can increase that field's power.
Sending the field into the leaves, they created a magnetic sheet!
Amazing!
You have a lot of tricks!
Are you guys, uh, human?
Were you sent down from heaven?
I've been wondering that, myself! I'm totally baffled!
And Baron Zeppeli, you're the biggest mystery of all!
Where did you learn to do this?!
I came across a mysterious man at a port town in India.
He was young and shabby-looking, but called himself a doctor.
I was in for a shock.
He took a gangrenous limb and healed it with light from his hands.
It was the power of Hamon.
I felt that Hamon might be the key to fighting the evil stone mask.
So I traveled far up Tibet's Salween River in search of the doctor's master.
His name was Tonpetty.
Stranger from a distant land, I can see your future.
Is it your desire to train with me?
To do so would alter your fate.
You will be destined to die.
I accept that.
I have a purpose worth risking my life for.
I can't share Tonpetty's prophecy with anyone, even JoJo.
Y-You all right?
T-That sound. Is that Hamon, too?
I-It's not!
It's Tarukus!
H-He's insane to leap in to attack us from that height!
This glider is made of pure Hamon. Touch it at your own peril.
What's that?!
T-The old knights' training ground!
Jump for it before Tarukus knocks us down!
That lunatic! He slammed straight into the wall!
That'll destroy even a zombie.
Unlike Dio, he can't regenerate, so he should be finished.
H-He's a machine!
He lives only for fighting.
His bones should've been powdered by that!
He's climbing up!
Our goal is to destroy Dio, but he insists on getting in our way.
We will eliminate Tarukus here!
JoJo, take the boy somewhere safe inside!
There's something strange about this door.
C-Careful! These ruins are where the knights trained to kill.
They say it's full of traps!
Jonathan! Something's coming!
- Oh, no! - JoJo!
W-What is this?!
Tarukus!
The Lair of the Two-headed Dragon.
A chain death match after 300 years of boredom sounds perfect.
The Lair of the Two-headed Dragon, an ancient sparring ground!
Home of the chain death match!
I killed 48 here.
You could call this sport my specialty.
S-Stop, Baron Zeppeli! It's just too thick!
Y-Yikes! He's ruined his hands!
U-Unfortunately Hamon cannot be used for destruction.
Bricks I can handle, but not this door.
JoJo is the same.
The key to the collar on your neck is right here!
The doors can't be opened from the outside during a match.
The key to my collar is on yours.
That means that taking the head of your opponent...
...is the only way out of here!
Overdrive!
T-The chain is touching the ceiling
My left humerus is cracked.
I can use Hamon energy to fix it.
But to do that, I need to get this collar off!
I can't breathe!
JoJo!
D-Damn! I wet my pants!
I-I have to get away from these guys!
They've brought disaster to my town!
Baron Zeppeli, that lever!
The door can be opened from the inside!
JoJo will fight on his own.
But his battle with Blueford has left him weak.
I don't care how! We have to find a way to join him!
I don't see any way in!
It's too small.
They could never fit through.
But...
...maybe I could.
Blast it!
We can't get the door open.
We'll have to use the cliff entrance Tarukus used.
B-But that'll take too much time!
We've got no other option.
I'm always on the sidelines!
I'm powerless!
I can do nothing to help!
Look at me, Poco!
I said look at me!
Aww, he's scared!
He's quaking like a leaf!
Look! Look!
He's gonna cry!
U-Uh oh!
L-Let's get outta here!
S-Sis...
Taking it from those bullies again?
Come on, now.
I-I'll fight them...tomorrow!
So when is tomorrow?
Um, tomorrow.
Poco...
What is the scariest thing to you?
Is it that sting you feel?
Is pain scary?
Don't you think growing up being unable to do anything...
...would be scarier than pain?
I-I...
Relax, baby brother.
I'll do the laundry when we get home.
Poco!
A window!
Hey! Don't go in there, you fool!
Stop him! Tarukus would butcher a man going in there, let alone a child!
Listen, kid! It's too dangerous!
Think what will happen if those monsters win!
If that big JoJo guy dies, they'll attack our town!
They'll attack Sis!
I have to be the one to protect Sis!
Sis! Tomorrow is now!
Stay back! It's not safe!
Keep out of this, brat!
Poco!
Pain isn't...
...what's scary.
I did it.
You did well, Poco.
Don't worry, you're not that hurt.
Now, Baron Zeppeli! Go in there and crush him!
Baron?
You will be destined to die.
At last...
Is it time for the prophecy to be fulfilled?
If it is fate, I will simply accept it.
Baron Zeppeli!
What did you just say?
Next episode
This is just too cruel!
You'll pay, Tarukus!
I'll stomp you!
JoJo, please, take up my torch!

The guardian of the pyramids, the Sphinx, asked travelers this riddle.
The answer is "Humans."
Legend says that those who could not answer were eaten by the Sphinx.
Cairo is immense.
We're finally here.
Jotaro and the others have arrived in Cairo.
Welcome, foreigners. What would you like?
There's something I'd like to ask you.
We're looking for the building in this picture.
Do you know where it is?
Joseph and the others were exhausted.
These are spirit pictures that
Where is DIO?
Sirs, this is a café. Please order something.
Four iced teas.
Nope, I don't recognize it.
Cairo has a population of six million.
There must be two to three million buildings.
Will we be able to find him?
There has to be someone...
This building, huh?
I can't tell from just a picture...
Sorry, it doesn't look familiar.
I see. Sorry to bother you.
Come on. Let's continue our investigation.
I know that building.
What?!
No doubt about it. It's building.
Spread
Episode 34 D'Arby the Gambler, Part 1
W-Was it you who just said that?
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
I just heard someone say they know this building.
Yes.
What? Really?!
That's great to hear!
Yes! We're pretty lucky to have found someone who knows
Where? Please tell us! Where is it?
Are you asking me to give you the answer for free?
Y-You've got a point. Sorry about that.
I'll pay you ten pounds.
So, where is it?
I love gambling.
I'm a sucker for cheap thrills.
Well, you could say that I make my living gambling.
Do you like gambling?
I'm not sure what you're getting at.
If you don't like gambling, just say so.
I'm asking you exactly what you mean by that.
Well... Would you make a silly little wager with me?
If you win, I'll tell you where that place is for free.
I'll give you another twenty pounds, so please just tell us.
The thing about gambling is, you can do it with anything.
It won't take any time at all.
Now, why don't we bet on which smoked fish that cat will eat first?
Right or left?
How about it? It's silly, but thrilling.
Hey! You're really starting to annoy me!
Just take the thirty pounds, and hurry up and tell us!
Polnareff, that's not the way to ask someone for information.
Okay, fine! Then I'll make a bet.
Good! Now it's getting fun.
Hey, now...
Hey, Jotaro. Isn't he rather suspicious?
Yeah... He might be an enemy Stand user.
But he might just be a compulsive gambler.
If he does anything even remotely strange, plow through him with Star Platinum.
Got it.
By the way, if I lose, what am I supposed to pay you?
Like, a hundred pounds?
I don't need money.
What?
What kind of joke is that? Cocky bastard.
Your answer?
Yeah, okay, sure. That's fine.
Oh? The cat has taken notice of the smoked fish.
The right.
The kitty's going to the right.
If I were a cat, I'd pick the bigger one.
The one on the right looks bigger!
You saw it.
I win.
Hey, you lost, Polnareff. What are you going to do now?
I'm getting sick of asking around about that building.
Now, then. As per our agreement, let's have you pay up.
Huh? Pay? Pay what?
Your soul.
That is indeed what you just wagered.
Your soul!
I am a Stand user that steals souls!
Gambling makes it easier for the human soul to leave its vessel.
It is my Stand's power to steal it at that moment!
What?! What's going on?!
Grab
Polnareff!
Hold it! Don't kill me. It's too late!
If I die, Polnareff's soul, which is in my Stand's grasp, will also die.
Polnareff!
H-Hey!
H-He has no pulse.
He's dead! Polnareff is dead!
Polnareff!
This is Polnareff's soul.
Even if he was just a fool.
It's a little overdue, but allow me to introduce myself.
My name is D'Arby.
D-A-R-B-Y. There's an apostrophe after the D.
The Stand that steals souls from those who lost a bet...
The one that suggests Osiris.
By the way, this is my cat.
Y-You bastard!
Don't screw with us! A bet? It was just a scam!
A scam?
I believe gambling is just like relationships.
It's all about fooling the other.
The one who cries loses.
Are you going to kill me with your bare hands?
Very well. Do it.
Listen here.
Do you remember what you were doing on the night of
What are you talking about?
I remember.
This is him.
The one below is Moor's father, and his wife is right next to him.
If you want to get Polnareff's soul back, you have no choice but to continue
gambling with me.
Th-This man is a demon...
He's planning to take us, one by one.
What will you do?
And leave Polnareff behind.
Well, have a drink and think about it long and hard.
How about some chocolate?
M-Mr. Joestar, what are you trying to do?
Have you heard of surface tension, Barbie?
It's D'Arby. My name is D'Arby.
It's the force that's keeping that drink from breaking the surface, correct?
What do you plan to do?
The rules are simple.
The one who makes it overflow loses.
Hey, old man...
Y-You can't mean... Mr. Joestar!
I'll wager my soul on it!
Osiris
D'Arby Elder
I'll wager my soul on it!
Good!
What?!
Impossible! P-Please don't! He's a con artist!
I won't let him cheat!
Jotaro, make sure he doesn't cheat.
Okay! That's fine. I shall take this bet.
But first...
Of course, you have that right.
You also have the right to make sure I'm not cheating.
I am a gambler. I do have my pride.
If I lose, I always pay up. I won't lose, though.
Very well. You can go first. Put in a coin.
Mr. Joestar!
Just leave this to me.
I'm an expert at this trick with a glass and coins.
I'm not easy to beat when surface tension is involved.
It should fit about eight or nine more coins...
As long as I can remain calm and my fingers don't shake.
May I put in more than one coin at a time?
If you can do it all at once.
Well, then...
F-Five?!
Hey, I think I saw a little wave there.
Quiet!
Don't touch the table.
It's your turn.
Your guts are quite impressive, to put in five at once.
I'll go with one.
That was too close.
The old man...
Liquid is dripping from it.
And you wanted me to watch for cheating?
You scoundrel...
No more will fit!
It's not a scam if you're not caught! That's what he said himself.
This is bad for my heart. I thought it was going to spill...
Now it's your turn, Obie.
It's D'Arby. Don't mistake that again!
It's not Obie or Barbie!
My apologies.
He's screwing up his name on purpose to make him agitated.
He's a gambler at heart.
Let's continue our wager.
There's a shadow, so this angle is difficult.
I'll put it in from the right side of the table.
You may put it in from wherever you like.
Though because of my cheat, it's already at its limit.
It'll overflow if he even touches the surface.
You're thinking that this glass's surface tension is at it's limit.
That it's impossible, right?
But that's not true...
I-Impossible! It can't be!
What do you mean, there's no way it wouldn't overflow?
As you can see, it went in.
He made no suspicious moves that could've been cheating.
I was watching with Star Platinum.
He put the coin in fairly.
There's no doubt about it.
B-But I made sure!
I made sure that it would overflow if one more was added!
Why? There's no way one more could have gone in!
Go ahead, Mr. Joestar.
Hurry it up.
I-I can't believe it.
Mr. Joestar!
Joestar acknowledged in his mind that he'd already lost the bet!
That's why his soul emerged.
I, D'Arby, have won this bet!
Polnareff, I'm sorry.
Mr. Joestar!
Old man!
That's two!
As long as you two don't abandon
You bastard!
You don't learn, do you?
If you kill me, these two souls will die, as well.
Damn it!
Avdol, stop!
Hey! If you're going to make trouble, I'll have to ask you to leave!
Shut it. Stay out of this.
Yes, sir!
You realized it too late, Jotaro.
Is there something wrong with the glass?
This is how one more coin went in.
There was a tiny bit of chocolate on the bottom of the glass's outside.
he asked to inspect the glass and coins, and that's when he stuck it on.
I believe you were aware that
Wh-What do you mean?
This side will spill
Glass is tilted
Once it melted, the surface became level.
Surface tension becomes equal
It melts
he made it so at least one more coin would fit.
Wh-What?!
B-But...
He melted it using the sun's heat.
He went to the right side of the table
Fine.
J-Jotaro!
Rumble
How interesting!
Poker? This man just beat Mr. Joestar!
I-It's too dangerous!
I know.
But...
I can't afford not to do this.
Next Episode Preview
Draw three.
I'll draw two.
He's not doing anything suspicious, and yet...
Cheating is all about finding a mental blind spot.
There's only one joker.
Well, then, Jotaro...
Very well. I'll wager my soul.

Before we get started, there's something I want to try.
Shuffle those cards.
They're shuffled.
What now?
but pick a card from anywhere near the deck's top and flip it.
Only show yourself the card.
Okay, I've looked.
I'll tell you which card it is: the six of hearts.
I'll name the cards in order from the top.
Five of spades, queen of diamonds, jack of spades, ace of hearts...
Seven of diamonds, six of clubs, king of clubs, two of diamonds.
That's correct!
How did you...?
I can name all of the cards, in order, from top to bottom.
My Star Platinum was able to see the order of the cards as they were being shuffled.
That's very interesting.
But that just means I have to make sure you don't see me shuffling the cards.
Don't you get it?
I just wanted to let you know that.
Good.
Episode 35 D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
The security seal.
There's one joker.
I don't see anything unusual.
They're ordinary playing cards.
I'm at 538...
540... No, 556 pages.
I'm at my best again today.
I can figure out which page I'm on just by the feel.
Jotaro's Star Platinum may indeed have impressive eyes.
But I, D'Arby, can memorize by touch.
Even when I shuffle the cards, I know exactly where each is going.
Okay! Open the game!
Ten of hearts.
Seven of clubs.
Looks like I'm the dealer.
I'd better shuffle at an angle Star Platinum can't see them from.
Cut, if you please.
And now, I shall deal.
To Jotaro, to me, to Jotaro, to me...
Wh-What?! What happened?!
Jotaro, his finger!
Star Platinum just broke D'Arby's finger out of the blue!
I told you.
What? Cheating? When? He was just dealing the cards...
He didn't make any suspicious moves.
No. Take a good look at the cards in his left hand.
The second card is sticking out...
That's the card he just tried to give me.
but he was actually trying to give me the second card from the top.
That means...
The card on top would have gone to him.
He would've had three tens with that card.
This technique is called second dealing.
It takes advantage of the assumption that the cards are dealt from the top.
Instead, this advanced technique deals the second card from the top.
it's impossible for the human eye to keep up.
And in addition, D'Arby is a man who can memorize the position of every card.
Wh-What a horrible man. Breaking my finger...
No, I'm being forgiving. I could've just cut your finger off.
Good grief. I can't trust you to shuffle the cards.
Let's have someone who's not playing deal.
Let's ask the boy on top of that hill.
Good.
Avdol, could you bring him here?
All right.
Impressive...
To cheat, one must take advantage of psychological blind spots.
You need more than sharp eyes to see through cheating.
It seems I underestimated you, since you saw
I shall accept what happened to my finger as punishment for that.
And now, I shall dedicate all I have to playing this game with you, Jotaro.
This is my biggest game since May 17th, 1986.
At that time, I won eight properties
He was a rich man, and a very strong man.
You see, I'm not facing you for Lord DIO's sake.
I'm facing you because I'm a born gambler.
Wh-What are you planning to do with Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls?!
I have split their souls into six chips each.
you're allowed to fold.
Understood?
but I haven't heard you say a certain line yet.
Fine. I'll bet my soul.
Good!
Jotaro...
The chips that are as white as snow represent your soul.
you will lose your soul.
Osiris
D'Arby Elder
I will use one of Polnareff's chips as my opening ante.
Let us begin!
In poker, each player is dealt five cards.
it becomes a complex psychological game.
Now, I shall discard two cards.
Jotaro, your soul is represented by a mere six chips.
Make sure you consider your moves carefully.
Boy, you don't need to understand what's going on.
Don't worry about a thing. Just shuffle and deal the cards normally.
O-Okay...
I'll take three cards.
My, my. What a frightening expression.
Maybe I should play it safe and bet just one Polnareff.
Call.
If neither one folds, they'll need at least three chips per hand.
All right! It's game time, Jotaro!
Two pair, nines over eights.
I'm so sorry.
Two pair, queens over jacks.
That was close. I almost lost.
So then...
H-He's only got three chips left.
J-Jotaro...
Next hand. Deal.
It might not just be the next hand, but your last.
I'll draw one card.
What's the matter, Jotaro?
you'll bet or fold.
Jotaro?
I'll...
keep my cards as they are.
What?!
Ah, forgive me, but...
What did you say?
You heard right. I'm keeping my cards.
I'll play with these five cards.
I understand that!
I'm asking if you intend
These cards are fine.
You can't be serious! Answer me!
By the way, Avdol, I have a request.
A request?
R-Right. Of course, but why aren't you looking at your cards?
I told you to answer me, Jotaro!
In addition to my last three chips...
I'll wager Avdol's soul.
Wh—
What?!
D'Arby, you're a calm man. Every move you make is calculated.
You may not be powerful, but you are truly strong.
I am not a man suited to gambling, as I easily become emotional.
If I played you, I would most likely lose.
But I believe in Jotaro.
but if Jotaro has asked me to wager, I shall do so in total faith.
Even if that wager is for my soul.
Well, this is...
You've both been overwhelmed by excitement. You aren't thinking straight.
Boy!
I said I was changing one card. Hurry it up.
O-Okay...
Mr. D'Arby, I did just as you said.
I gave this Japanese guy useless cards that won't amount to anything.
My skill never fails.
You will win. There's no doubt about it.
but not only are all of the people in the café working for me, so is everyone in view.
That includes the owner and those men, too.
No matter who deals, I can't fail!
But it's a bluff! How dare he try bluffing against me?
Does he actually think I'll fold? What a fool...
Hmph. Very well.
But on top of that...
I shall raise you all six of Joestar's chips.
That brings the total to fifteen.
What?
Wh-What?! Hold on a minute!
What are you talking about? Of course he does.
What do you mean?
Well, for proof, I'll need you to write this down.
Then my Stand will be able to work.
What are you talking about?
You have the soul of Kakyoin, who's still in the hospital.
What?!
Now, time to be frightened! You're going to lose even more confidence!
I'll see your cool facade crumble right before my eyes!
How dare you try to bluff me, D'Arby?
I won't be satisfied until I see
your poker face collapse into terror when you lose!
Fine.
I shall wager Kakyoin's soul, too.
J-Jotaro!
Is that going too far?
Hey, Jotaro! What did you just do?!
What did I do? What are you talking about?
You just lit a cig—
Is something the matter? Are you not feeling well?
Th-This little...
His confidence! He couldn't possibly...
Could he have used Star Platinum to switch the cards while I wasn't looking?
Menacing
I, Jotaro Kujo, will wager my friend Noriaki Kakyoin's soul, and offer it if I lose. —Jotaro Kujo
Menacing
I, Jotaro Kujo, will wager my friend Noriaki Kakyoin's soul, and offer it if I lose. —Jotaro Kujo
Menacing
S-Stupid brat!
If they find out you're working for me, I'll kill you!
You fool! Damn it!
I have four kings in my hand.
Four Aces
Straight Flush
Five of a Kind
it could only happen after replacing all five cards.
Of course not! There's no chance in hell!
There's no way he could have switched
All right, Jotaro! Let's do this!
Y-You've got a drink?! When did you...
Y-You bastard! How dare you underestimate me?!
Very well, let us do this!
My cards are—
Hold it.
I still have the right to raise.
What?!
R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Raise?! You don't have anything left to wage—
I raise you my mother's soul.
What?!
You mother?! Jotaro, Ms. Holly's soul...
Bang
I came to Egypt to save my mother.
So if I wager her soul, she won't complain.
But, D'Arby, you'll have to match my mother's soul.
For that...
I'll have you tell me the secret of DIO's Stand!
His demeanor...
But traitors will be killed.
it means that D'Arby's life is good as over.
you must be sure to win, right?
I can believe that, right?
Well? Do you bet or not?
I'll say it!
I'll say it, damn it!
I'll say it!
I'm the greatest gambler in the world!
I'll take this bet! I'll call!
Call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call...
I'm going to call!
C— C— Ca— C— C-C-C—
I-I can't! I'm terrified! I can't speak!
I'm so scared, I c-c-can't speak!
C-C-C-C...
I-I can't... I can't breathe...
C-C-C-C-Ca—
This guy... H-He passed out!
He's standing, but he's unconscious!
He got so nervous, he passed out.
Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls are coming back! We're saved!
He gave up on the wager in his heart.
He admitted defeat, so their souls were released.
F-Four of a kind!
J-Jotaro, what in the world was your hand?
I-I knew it...
Woozy
All of the cards I dealt him were worthless!
Even Star Platinum wouldn't be able to cheat someone like D'Arby.
but with such a worthless hand...
Good grief. If I had known, I would have freaked out.
F-Freaked out?
It appears his collection has been freed to cross over, as well.
Come on, everyone! Let's all play mahjong!
Backgammon is a lot of fun, too, and dice games are thrilling.
Though I'll beat you all!
Osiris's D'Arby: Retired
Osiris's D'Arby has retired.
I don't think we'll be able to get DIO's secret out of him now.
Yeah. But he was a strong enemy.
Yes, he was truly terrifying.
I'm not sure what's going on, but yeah.
We didn't get to look good at all this time.

Damn, it's dark. My eyes won't adjust.
Where the hell did he go?
It's midday, but it's been such a pain in the ass
I think DIO was in that room over there...
Wh-What's that? DIO's leftovers?
None of these women resisted.
I'll never understand what they're thinking.
I guess he's charming as the Devil himself.
And while I'm at it, where did he get
I guess there's nothing he can't do.
Did you
want something?
L-Lord DIO!
D-Damn it.
J-Just standing in front of him sends chills up my spine.
Calm down, Hol Horse.
He's nothing. He's only a little stronger than me, maybe...
I asked you what you're doing here, Hol Horse.
Ah, uh, w-well... I-I came to give my report.
It appears that the fifth and sixth of the
And?
A-And that was my report.
Joestar and the others will arrive in Cairo tomorrow.
Only three of the Nine Gods remain.
When I said, "And?"
I was talking about you, Hol Horse.
Huh?!
When are you going to fight them for me, Hol Horse?
You swore loyalty to me, but you haven't really fought at all.
Anyone can give me reports.
and came running back here.
My body, from the neck down, once belonged to a man named Jonathan Joestar.
He was Joseph Joestar's grandfather.
Look at these two fingers.
See how the left side is slower to heal?
The left side of this body is weak.
That proves this body isn't yet completely mine.
That I'm not immortal yet.
So I am not yet prepared to face them.
I expect you to kill Joestar and the others for me this time.
Otherwise, I'll kill you.
Y-You've got to be shitting me!
"For me"?
Don't you mock me.
I just side with whoever's strongest.
I didn't swear loyalty to you from the bottom of my heart.
I'm not gonna sell you my soul.
Damn it! Are you even all that strong?
Your back is wide open!
Maybe your body isn't moving the way you want it to yet...
C-Come to think of it, instead of fighting the four guys in Joestar's party...
He's alone right now.
It'd be quicker and easier to blow his head to smithereens
Then all that treasure will be mine.
He's totally open!
I'm pointing the Emperor's barrel right at him, and he hasn't even noticed.
I can finish him off now.
Just gotta pull the trigger...
It'll be over in an instant.
The Emperor was made for killing at point blank range!
I can do this. I absolutely can!
What are you doing? Hurry up and get going.
I'll kill you!
I'll leave your brains all over the floor, DIO!
Are you really trying to shoot me?
H-He's gone.
I like you.
you weren't sweating, and your breathing was even.
You were absolutely calm. As I'd expect from Hol Horse.
I-I couldn't see him move.
And even at that...
There's no way he could have gotten behind me!
It wasn't speed.
How?! How did he get behind me?
I don't understand.
You're not ready to fight them? Bullshit!
that I have no choice but to follow you.
I-I've lost completely...
Episode 36 Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 1
Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you enjoyed your flight from Aswan.
Our plane will momentarily land on schedule at Cairo International Airport.
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Whoops! Sorry 'bout that.
Looks like we got to this taxi first.
See ya.
What? Got a problem, dumbass?
H-How horrible...
Take me to the Mena House hotel in Giza.
Huh? Did you just say something, sir?
I wasn't talking to you.
Y-Yes, sir.
Mondatta, I had no choice but to drag you
Don't be a baby, Mondatta.
You're going to team up with me now.
we're going to kill Joestar's group.
Got it, Mondatta?
I know that you're an introvert who won't trust anyone
But don't you want to avenge your brother?
Do you want to grow up a coward, Mondatta?
I'm doing my best, too!
We've got to fight!
Get your revenge, Mondatta!
I'm going to untie you now.
All right. Good boy.
Don't work yourself up. You'll get sick.
I'm on your side. Don't worry.
Sir?! Wha— Are you throwing up?!
Shut up!
Oh... You were airsick?
Anyway, l-let's be pals, Mondatta.
I'm Mondatta. This is Hol Horse.
He's super mean and a total jerk!
and took me away from my brother Zenyatta.
It's so sad!
I worked up my courage and paired up with Hol Horse.
you're trying to be brave in your own way.
Is it really true that your Stand's predictions are always right?
but your brother's failure worries me a bit.
Answer me! They're absolute, right?!
A new comic appeared on the blank page...
While Hol Horse and I
we met a very pretty lady.
Fabam!
Suddenly, he jump kicked her!
Hooray!
Yay! We're rich!
What is this?!
You've got to be kidding me!
You call this a prediction, Mondatta?!
It's insane! There's no way this could happen!
M-M-M-My... My Th-Thoth's comic book predictions
a-a-a-are absolute!
Yes, 100%.
100%?! Stop messing with me, kid!
What kind of woman would be so happy about getting kicked
Menacing
Listen, Mondatta.
When it comes to women, no one's a nicer guy than me.
I may lie to women, but I've never hit one!
It doesn't matter to me if she's ugly or beautiful. I respect women.
This prediction will not come true.
And even if someone paid me a ton of money, I'd never kick one.
I-It's 100%, yes.
See? Your prediction was wrong!
Who the hell are you?!
This is... There was a scorpion inside my lady's collar!
And it's a highly venomous species!
What?
You saw the scorpion
If he hadn't crushed it, you would have been stung...
You saved my life. Please, allow me to thank you.
How about my necklace?
We're invincible!
Mondatta, and I, Hol Horse, are an invincible duo!
Thoth
Mondatta
The building in this picture, huh?
but I've never seen this place.
That means you should
The further south you go in Cairo, the older the buildings are.
Huh...
Sorry I couldn't be much help.
No, thanks a lot. Sorry to bother you.
Okay. I understand. Thank you.
I called Japan...
My daughter's condition has worsened.
She has no strength left.
I can feel it.
I can feel him hiding somewhere around here.
He's definitely close.
Let's go.
Yes, let's go. We'll keep asking.
We meet again, you familiar faces...
Or something like that.
To think they've gotten so close to Lord DIO's mansion...
They're almost there.
By the way...
Mondatta!
About your new prediction... I really can't believe it.
There's no way something that ridiculous could actually happen!
M-M-M-My, my—
Your predictions are 100% accurate, right?
Th-They are, yes.
Damn it! Are you telling me to believe this?
Ta-da!
"I've finally found you... Joestar, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol!
Damn it! They're getting closer and closer to Lord DIO's mansion.
You fools. I'm just going to shoot you in the face right now!"
Grudge Grudge
...thought Hol Horse, resentfully.
Run Run
"I'll avenge my brother!"
...I thought, angrily.
But, Hol Horse, you shouldn't even think
Now, Hol Horse, stick your fingers up Polnareff's nose, and then...
Jam
Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!
Lucky you, Hol Horse! This is your chance to kill them all!
Like hell I'm gonna believe that!
You call this a prediction?
Stick my fingers up Polnareff's nose?!
What the hell?! Well, Mondatta?!
I get that it's a chance to kill them all, but it's absolutely ludicrous.
Listen. Even if that happened, I'd have to get close enough
Wouldn't it be much faster if I just shot him with my Emperor?
Y-You won't be able to f-fire a bullet, yes.
E-Even if you try to shoot, fate will make you follow the comic, yes.
Y-You must believe, yes.
you will only suffer.
I-It is fate, yes. It is 100% accurate, yes.
But your brother failed.
M-My brother was trying to save himself
then the real Jotaro would've blown up, yes.
The predictions are not wrong, yes.
What to do...
P-Polnareff is gone.
Hey, where's Polnareff?
Shit! It can't be...
Don't move!
P-Polnareff...
Idiot! Don't try anything funny.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
and if it isn't a visit from my old friend, Mr. Hol Horse.
Still haven't learned your lesson? Still trying to kill us?
You took real good care of us in India.
Are you alone, Hol Horse?
Nah, you wouldn't be here alone.
I'm sure you've got someone nearby.
Damn it!
I still have a chance...
Your hand's showing! Your damn fingers!
So where's the Stand user you've partnered up with?
Menacing
Your fingers...
Tuck your fingers in, Mondatta.
B-Believe!
Believe in destiny.
Th-Then our victory will be absolute, yes.
Hey, what's under that box? Someone's in there!
Hey, Polnareff, did you find the guy following us?
Gah! That's Avdol's voice! H-He's coming!
Believe, yes!
S-Seriously?! Damn it...
I'll do it! I just have to do it, right?
Whoever's under there, get out!
Now's my chance! He's looking the other way!
I know you're hiding under there!
What the?!
Yes!
Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!
Lucky you, Hol Horse! This is your chance to kill them all!
So, when the hell is this chance coming?
Ache
What the hell are you doing, Hol Horse?
I'd like to know myself!
What the hell am I supposed to do after this?
What am I supposed to follow up with?
What's the matter, Polnareff?
He's not responding.
That's odd.
Sh-Shit! Th-The other three are coming this way!
Damn it!
What the hell am I supposed to do?!
Next Episode Preview
Damn it! I've been cornered!
It's a sign for you to look behind me!
Looks like there was a car accident over there.
I made tea, so have some lunch.
Once I stuck my fingers up his nose, the prediction came true.
My premonitions are absolute. It is fate, yes.

How am I supposed to make it like the prediction from here?
Polnareff, did you find the guy following us?
Answer us.
Avdol and the others are c-coming.
This is bad... Very bad!
Chario—
Whoa, now!
Crap...
Y-Yes! I'm faster.
Don't move. I'll shoot!
Hey, can you hear me, Polnareff?
Hey, Polnareff!
Oh, there you are.
What's the matter?
E-Er...
Damn it! I've been cornered.
This situation is the exact opposite!
Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders
Episode 37 Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 2
Is something the matter, Polnareff?
No...
If Avdol were to find me now, I'd be killed!
I feel like crying.
If I'd known this was going to happen, I would've
Mondatta, that bastard.
Damn it!
Polnareff?
Hurry up and get them to leave!
N-No one was following us.
I see...
Tell them you were about to take a piss. A piss!
W-Well, you know... I needed to take a piss.
What?
Seriously, you were taking a piss?
That's an embarrassing thing to do in the middle of a city.
Damn bastard, jabbing that gun into my head...
Come on, guys. Figure it out.
Lick
Lick
Lick
Look where my tongue is pointing!
It's a sign for you to look behind me! Behind me!
Behind me, damn it! Behind me!
Why are they being so quiet?
A-Anyway, that's what's up. You guys can go on ahead.
All right.
That was a lie!
Behind me, damn it! Figure it out!
Is something wrong?
No, I think he's saying something's behind—
Idiot! Don't say it!
You don't mean...
P-Polnareff!
Did you give them...
some kind of signal?!
Damn it! I'm pissed off now!
I'll... I'll kill you!
Die!
What?!
Huh?
Hey, he's...
Wh-What? You're kidding me! He sneezed?!
It's Hol Horse. Be careful!
You can't be serious. This is impossible.
Sticking my fingers up his nose made him sneeze!
I should have never teamed up with you, Mondatta!
I failed thanks to your prediction, damn it!
I'm doomed.
B-Bro, look! That one guy is over there.
That's him, all right.
He's the bastard who blew my ear off outta nowhere at the airport.
I'll run him over!
What?!
Crash
Th-This is...
It was so sudden, even they couldn't get their Stands
I stuck my fingers up his nose, and the prediction came true.
I can't believe it. All four of them at once...
It is fate, yes.
My premonitions are absolute.
But it's too early to finish them off.
We must see what the next prediction says, yes.
Okay!
Emperor
Hol Horse
Crash
"Yay! The chance to kill them has arrived!
But be careful.
"It's still too soon to get close to them.
The other three have passed out, but Jotaro's still awake.
Dash
He's standing up!"
So Jotaro dodged the truck just a second before.
That was close.
He's looking for me.
He must be wondering why I disappeared without finishing them off.
You want to beat them, don't you, Mondatta?
we've got to win, no matter what.
Yeah...
We're just one step away from victory.
So Mondatta, what do we have to do to finish them off?
Your comic's predictions are 100% absolute.
I believe them.
I'll do whatever they tell me to.
If it's sticking my fingers up something, I'll do it.
If I have to eat shit, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
I want to win!
Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-There it is!
I-It has finally appeared, yes.
Th-The final prediction!
What?
Bam
Now, Hol Horse's next attack will be the climax!
Hol Horse found some guys working on sewage pipes.
He paid them so they'd open up a section of the pipes.
If Hol Horse fires all of his bullets into that pipe at noon sharp...
Bang Bang
Hey, looks like there was a car accident around the corner.
Just leave it. Let's hurry up and finish this job.
Hold this pipe for a sec.
Okay.
Menacing
Menacing
Wh-What's going to happen if I fire into that pipe?
Hurry up and turn the page!
The bullets will come shooting out of the pipe.
Boom! Hol Horse's bullets shot through his brain!
Right smack in the middle of his forehead!
Y-Yay!
I was waiting for this, yes.
This is amazing!
I-It's amazing, but hang on!
We'll be in trouble if we interpret it wrong.
L-Look at this page from earlier.
Kabam
This is the prediction that appeared before your brother got blown up.
This is what happened to your brother!
But y-you and I cannot transform, yes.
That's... That's right! I can't transform!
I won't even attempt to act like Jotaro.
Wh-Which means...
Th-That's correct, yes.
There is no mistake in this prediction, yes.
Bang Bang
If you shoot your bullets into this pipe, Jotaro will die, yes.
But wait.
At noon sharp?
Wait, noon sharp?!
D-Don't panic. Y-You just have to shoot into the pipe, yes.
You have plenty of time, yes.
I-I know. It's 100%!
I believe... I believe, but...
Since there's a specific time...
It's making me panic!
H-Hey, you guys! Listen up.
Take a section of this pipe off.
Hurry up!
Hey, who do you think you're talking to?
Who the hell do you think you are?
I'll kill you! Hurry up and open it!
M-Mr. Hol Horse, ordinary people cannot see your Stand, yes.
And the comics say to pay them, yes.
What? Pay?
I only have a minute and ten seconds left!
A-A-All right! Sorry! I'll pay you, so open it!
Pay us? What a weirdo.
Okay, then, sure. Hurry up and pay us.
R-Right...
Hey, what's the problem?
I don't have any money!
What the hell?
M-Mondatta...
I gave you a coin purse just in case you got lost, didn't I?
R-Right.
There's only forty seconds left. Hurry!
I-It's mostly coins, but... Here's the coin purse.
Hey, I saw one fly over there into the shadows.
It's just change, but there's quite a bit. How much is there?
At least twenty pounds! Hey, you're stepping on one.
Oh, you're right.
Pick it up later! You can have it all!
Everyone, it's coming up noon.
Oh, good idea.
Damn you, old woman! This comes first! Butt out!
Thanks, ma'am.
Grarr
God damn it! I said to hurry up and open it!
Or I'll split your heads open with this rock!
I-It's open.
Out of the way!
Die, Jotaro!
I did it! I shot into it at noon sharp, just like in the prediction!
Go!
Wake up, old man.
I-I'm mostly all right...
I, too, am merely scratched.
More importantly, Polnareff is...
Someone get this damn block off of me.
We won!
What?!
Hey, man.
Sorry, Jotaro.
but he stuck his fingers right up my nose.
How disgusting.
It still itches. Sorry.
M-My bullets...
They missed!
Mondatta! Wh-What the hell is going on?!
What the hell?!
I-I do not know, yes.
I can't believe it!
Look! Jotaro and the others are alive.
It's totally different from the prediction!
You little...
Please tune in again tomorrow.
And now for the news at noon...
Huh?
Huh?!
What?! It's noon now?
M-My watch... My watch...
It's fast!
Wh-Which means I shot my bullets noon.
It's noon right now!
What the hell is going to happen?
What's going to happen next?!
I-It can't be...
According to this prediction, the bullets
The direction...
Boom
What the hell is going to happen next?!
Hey, I heard screaming around that corner.
I don't know what's going on, but it's not good.
Let's get out of here.
What the hell happened to Hol Horse, anyway?
I don't know.
Hey, it's dangerous to hang around that pipe, Jotaro.
It's spraying filthy water.
Is he dead?
No, just in critical condition.
I have no idea what happened, though.
It looks like a bullet went through his forehead and out the top of his head.
One centimeter down, and he would have been dead.
Talk about a lucky man.
My prediction wasn't wrong.
And... this was Hol Horse's fate.
But that Jotaro...
How lucky can he be?
My brother and Hol Horse lost against fate.
The only one who could face someone so lucky is Lord DIO.
Let's just forget about Jotaro and his friends.
but for our happiness and to help people in trouble...
I'm sick of spending my life cowering under a box, afraid of everyone.
This fight has forced me to grow.
I'm going back, Brother.
To Aswan, to where you are.
S-Sorry. I kicked it without thinking.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Forgive me.
Wait, th-this dog...
Swell
Th-This dog! It couldn't be...
No!
Hey, by the way, where'd that dumbass dog go?
Iggy?
I told you that he'd be useless.
Ba-dum-tss!

Iggy hates being with others.
I was looking for you because I have a request.
No doubt about it. It's this mansion.
By the way, where'd Iggy go?
Good grief. I can't let a kid who likes dogs die.

The building in this picture, huh?
but I've never seen this place.
My daughter's condition has worsened.
She'll only last three or four more days.
I can feel it.
DIO is near here.
Let's go.
If we keep asking around, we'll find him.
Man, it's super hot today.
I haven't had a bath since yesterday.
My good looks are going to waste.
What the hell, man?!
How dense are you?!
You're a foreigner. Don't sit here like you're a beggar!
Who the hell gave you permission?
Ah, are you a needy foreigner?
This isn't much, but here you go.
Hey, this is...
Y-You bastard! How dare you?!
Territory?
Hey, Polnareff!
Don't sit there.
Is this guy a beggar?
Sorry. My friend doesn't know much about this city.
You should have just said so in the first place.
I'm a beggar who can't speak in public for professional reasons.
This city has a beggars' association.
Huh...
Even worse, you hurt my pride!
Maybe I'll start doing that.
By the way, I thought you looked familiar.
Aren't you Avdol, the fortune teller?
I heard that someone was trying to kill you, so you fled to Japan.
I've been looking for you
I'll pay well.
Fwoosh
I'm done with work for the day.
I can find the place from that picture in three hours.
Hey... Where did Iggy go, anyway?

Menacing
There's no doubt about it.
I found it in two hours.
Huh?
Crash
Iggy then thought to himself...
That bird is a Stand user like me.
A Stand of ice dropped that thing.
He eliminates those who try to enter it.
Wh-Which means that bird
will come after me next!
Since ancient times, the Egyptians had been hunting
is called the Eye of Horus.
The Eye of Horus is a design symbolizing fortune and glory.
His name is Pet Shop.
His Stand suggests the god of the heavens, Horus.
Iggy thought to himself...
I-It appears that I've stumbled upon
And...
It was that Stand's power that dropped that chunk of ice.
So he's not a guard dog, but a guard bird.
Menacing
Y-You've got to be kidding me.
I've got nothing to do with this DIO guy.
I was dragged to Egypt against my will
Like hell I'm going to fight!
fall in love with a hot bitch, and live a peaceful, carefree life.
Like hell I'm going to do something as dangerous as fighting this violent jerk
I'm just gonna act like a dumb mutt
Those eyes...
but I've worked hard to act like an idiot.
Hurry up and go back to the mansion, you birdbrain.
Oh, it's a bird.
What's with that bird? I-It's not even trying to dodge!
I-I can't stop in time!
I-I'm gonna run it over!
Wh-What was with that bird?
I-It was able to go under the car, despite how low it is?
Wh-What a crazy bastard...
He only attacks if you try to enter the mansion.
Well, it's not my problem.
Chibi! Buchi!
Chibi! Buchi! Where are you?
Hey, have you seen my two dogs?
Shut up! Don't ask me, I'm a dog.
It's not like I can talk. Are you stupid?
Th-That collar...
This is Chibi's collar!
And there's blood on it!
Chibi and Buchi...
Chibi! Buchi!
Hey, you're not...
You'll be killed!
Chibi! Buchi! Are you here?
Chibi! Buchi!
Chibi! Buchi!
This isn't my problem.
I don't care if some human kid dies.
Survival of the fittest is the law of nature.
Buchi! Chibi!
Idiots die. The careless die.
I'm don't want any trouble.
Chibi! Buchi! Where are you?
Bam
He's eating them! No!
Good grief.
I can't just stand by and let a boy who likes dogs
get killed!
Bang

Chibi! Buchi!
Damn it! I guess I'm gonna have to fight.

It seems this is the first time that
You birdbrain! Come at me! I'll kill you!
The average speed of a falcon's descent is over 300 kilometers per hour.
There is no organism that can move faster.
A falcon rips out its prey's vital organs
What? Did he just smile?
It looked like the corners of its rigid beak just edged up a little!
A smiling bird?
Wh-What is this?
The air's gotten awfully cold...
I-Ice is coming out of the ground!
C-Crap!
My Stand's feet are also rooted by the ice...
Crap!
Icicles?!
But seriously, Avdol...
Do you think that sunglasses guy can really find DIO's mansion?
He understands the complex geography of Cairo better than anyone else.
Believe in him and wait.
You say that, but...
We looked around for three days and couldn't find it.
It's hard for me to believe that he could find it in three hours.
You're getting repetitive, Polnareff.
Honestly. Can't you just calm down a bit?
Jeez. I haven't seen Iggy for a while, either.
Where the hell did that stupid mutt run off to?
Iggy hates being part of any group.
I'm sure he's close. He'll show up eventually.
Aren't dogs supposed to like humans?
What a shitty, cynical little mutt.
I managed to get away from him.
That thing's ice took the skin right off my paw pads...
Damn it! I should have just let that human kid die.
That bird's Stand is no joke.
There's something more to it.
I've got to hurry up and get the hell out of here.
Talk about holding a grudge!
Iggy has disappeared.
Where did he disappear to?
Damn it...
That ruthless bastard doesn't hold back.
But in the end, he's still just a bird.
This place reeks, but I guess I've gotta deal it.
I'll hide out down here for a while.
Wh-What the hell is this bird?!
Bam
Hey.
Talk about gullible.
What you thought you killed was actually just The Fool's shapeshifting sand!
All right! You must be pretty stupid if you fell for that.
Look at all that blood.
I never had any interest in you or your master DIO, anyway.
Let's just call it a draw.
You got to shoot me up with those ice missiles, too.
Wh-What the hell?
Hey! I said I won't go near your mansion anymore!
Let's stop this already. Okay?
So that's your Stand's actual design...
He used that thing to freeze the wound and stop the bleeding!
C-Crap!
H-He blocked the exit with ice when I wasn't looking!
The ice is coming this way!
Shit!
Ice is running all over the tunnel!
I-I've got to get out of this tunnel!
He blocked this exit, too!
He's planning to finish me off.
Talk about excessive!
He's a machine made to hunt and kill!
Not to mention, if he catches me, he'll eat me alive!
What?! M-My foot!
I-I can't get my foot out!
Next Episode Preview
Man, this is really not my day!
That stupid dog.
That birdbrain is really pissing me off.
It wouldn't be strange if there was a Stand user
I'm gonna have to do this...
If I don't, he's going to kill me!

it looks like he was wrong.
Eh, Avdol?
It's occurred to me that
it might be better if he didn't find it.
It may be
that he did find it, and that's why he hasn't returned.
Hey...
There could be a Stand user that prevents
It might have been too dangerous to ask that beggar
Hey, now...
M-My leg...
It got chopped off by that icicle.
If I didn't abandon my leg, I would have been finished.
I-I should hide here for a while.
I need to hide here and get him off my tail.
I'll have the Speedwagon Foundation make me an artificial leg.
God damn that birdbrain!
I will get you back for this. Damn it!
That noise...
It's the sound of something diving into the water.
I-It can't be...
It is not impossible for a bird to dive underwater.
Birds use lungs to breathe, just like humans and dogs.
Air Sac Lungs Air Sac
This means that a bird can stay underwater much longer than a dog.
S-Something's coming closer through the water.
That's impossible!
It couldn't be!

That asshole bird!
That bastard... Where'd he go?!
I-It's coming! It's coming again!

I deflected them!

And the icicle's starting to freeze over again from the root.
Wh-What the hell?
I-I get it.
surrounding this area!
The airway's been cut off!
B-But he's not trying to suffocate me.
He's trying to crush me!
It's no use. It's gonna collapse!
This power's ridiculous! I can't hold out!
There's infinite water around me that he can freeze.
Damn it!
I-I'm just going to have to dig my way out.
Man, today is really not my day!
My front leg gets ripped off, and that damn bird is too strong!
I'm at my limit. I'm going to be crushed.
I have to hurry up and dig a hole to escape.
Huh?
It's the birdbrain!
Open
He's gonna shoot an ice missile!
Crap! The Fool is behind me!
I don't have time to defend.
There's no way out, either!
I know! I-I'll just have to do this.
I'll let him crush it
and let the air pressure launch me forward!
I-I did it. I defeated him.
Stupid birdbrain. Serves you right...
B-But I'm done for.
I-I'm gonna drown.
And here I thought I'd live a life free of trouble...
I can't believe it!
That bird got you, didn't it? Just like he got my dogs...
It's okay.
Don't die! Hang in there!
I'll patch you right up.

Horus
Pet Shop
Damn that Iggy! Where the hell did he go?
He's gotta stop making trouble for us.
I'm worried. We haven't seen him for quite a while.
That stupid mutt!
What's the matter, Jotaro?
Is someone following us after all?
No... I thought I heard a voice calling for us.
A voice?
I-Iggy?!
Iggy!
What in the world happened?
Iggy's been badly injured!
Hey... He's missing a front leg...
D-Did he get run over by a car?
He's not the kind of dog that gets into car accidents.
You were attacked by the enemy, weren't you, Iggy?
But it looks like someone treated his wounds.
And with perfect surgical technique.
It wasn't Iggy's voice.
Someone was calling to us in human language.
It appears that Iggy had a run-in with the enemy.
I saw a boy holding him as he lay dying.
Just like the one
who treated my eyes.
Y-You're...
Kakyoin!
It's Kakyoin! Hey!
Kakyoin, are your eyes okay now?
I'm glad you're all safe.
It's great to see you!
Have your wounds healed?
Yes. I'm fine now.
That's good to hear.
Jotaro...
Hey, Iggy. Where are you going?
is apparently trying to lead us somewhere.
but he seems rather angry about how much pain he endured.
Just where is he trying to lead us?
Hey, Iggy, hold on.
Th-That car...
It's the luxury car that beggar was riding in.
Th-This wreckage is...
What did this? There's a huge hole, like something gigantic pierced it.
It's just as I feared.
I knew I shoudn't have asked him...
Is this the work of the Stand user that Iggy fought?
It seems there can be little doubt.
Iggy!
Hey, what is this?
This overwhelmingly oppressive feeling...
Where's Iggy
I already know. This atmosphere is...
This dark sensation...
Th-This mansion is...
The one from the picture.
Who would have thought you'd be the one to find it, Iggy?
housed the cause of all they've been through, their destiny: the embodiment of evil.
They had journeyed long and far to reach this place.
It was, indeed, a series of life-or-death battles that were no simple task to survive.
Tears, laughter, sadness, rage, and happiness.
it has indeed been nearly fifty days since they left Japan.
All to defeat DIO, and end this hundred-year-old destiny.
Joseph thought to himself.
He was determined to reach his goal
Kakyoin thought to himself.
Avdol thought to himself.
There was evil this world that must not
Polnareff thought to himself.
He would make DIO pay
Iggy thought to himself.
The reason he had to endure
So he was going to pay him back for it, no matter what.
And...
In other words, if we beat the shit out of DIO
He's here. There's no doubt about it, this presence is his.
Rumble
He's inside this mansion right now.
Which means that we...
...have finally reached the last stop on our journey.
Are you ready?
Bam
The gate's open.
But it was closed yesterday...
Just as I can sense his presence, he is aware that I have arrived.
Entering this mansion carelessly
Now...
The door opened! Watch out!
Hey, look at this corridor. I don't see any end to it.
It's not real, is it?
Polnareff, don't go through that door.
We should see at least one or two Stand users before DIO.
What the?! Something's coming!
Who the hell's that? Is he a Stand user?
Welcome.
I am the butler of this mansion.

Allow me to wager
that Star Platinum's first attack against me will...

Take that corner at full throttle!
If we don't defeat you, we won't be able to proceed.

I dunno what the hell that is, but it's no ordinary human!
Polnareff!
But no matter! I'll kill him!
A playing card?
Welcome. Master Joestar, we have been awaiting your arrival.
I am the butler of this mansion.
My name is D'Arby.
D'Arby?
Yes. I am D'Arby Younger.
I am the younger brother of D'Arby Elder, whom you have
Bam
You're the gambler D'Arby's younger brother?
Are you here to avenge your older brother?
No, not at all. I wouldn't even think of it.
Didn't my brother tell you
that the one who is fooled and loses the battle is at fault?
I believe that to be true, as well.
I don't bear a grudge at all.
My brother is my brother, and I am myself.
We are different people.
I am ten years younger than my brother.
but we are from different generations.
My brother is old-fashioned. He had to cheat and swindle to win.
He could only defeat those who were either old-fashioned or amateurs.
and that is why I am the one he chose to be his butler.
What is the matter?
please, come into the mansion.
Everyone, don't rush in there carelessly.
We don't have much time. Hurry up and take us to DIO.
Jotaro! Be careful! Something's coming out!
suggests the God Atum.
H-Hey, he brought out his Stand!
Well, that's rare these days.
It's been a while since we faced someone who used their Stand out in the open.
So who is it?
He's so annoying! Jotaro, beat the crap out of him!
Rumble
Let us make a wager.
will be a left-hand punch.
His first attack will be a punch thrown with his left arm.
Whatever! It's all the same if you hit him with everything you've got!
Do it!
Hurry up and hit him, Jotaro!
Bam
What? H-He dodged?
Such speed!
That's impossible.
Too bad. It seems I have lost this wager.
Just like my brother, I love gambling.
But I'm not very good at it.
As a reward, I shall take you to an amazing world.
What? A hole...
Curses! It was a trap after all!
Jotaro!
Jotaro's falling into the hole!
Oh, very well. You gentlemen may enter, too.
Wha—
Mr. Joestar! Kakyoin!
Wait! It would be too dangerous to follow them!
Avdol, can you hear me?
If you don't hear from us in ten minutes, set the mansion on fire!
Got it, Avdol?!
Mr. Joestar!
Episode 40 D'Arby the Player, Part 1
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
This illusion... Are we underground or above ground?
This wet feeling... This reality...
It's too convincing.
Old man. Kakyoin. Consider this mystery for me.
His Stand...
Why do you think that is?
If we don't solve that mystery, this guy will beat us.
Would you like something to drink?
Of course, the drinks are real. They are also not poisoned.
Is this inside the mansion?
It is.
Where inside the mansion?
I cannot disclose that.
Is it below ground?
It could be.
Is this illusion being created by a Stand?
Yes.
Is this your Stand's power?
It is not.
Is it DIO's?
It is not.
Whose is it?
That information is not necessary.
Is that true?
That information is not necessary.
Looks like we're not getting any straight answers.
I could lie to you.
So what are you getting at?
If we don't defeat you, we can't proceed?
Exactly!
That is indeed correct.
That needlessly polite attitude... This man gets on my nerves.
Have you forgotten that it's one against three?
We're in a hurry, so all three of us will attack you.
Now, don't be in such a hurry.
Before that, let's have a look
at my collection, shall we?
Collection?
Though it pales in comparison to my brother's, I also have a collection.
But one likes to hear compliments about their precious collection
It can't be...
Dolls? Wh-What are these dolls?!
No, Kakyoin.
of the D'Arby brothers, those can't be ordinary dolls.
Squirm
D-D'Arby...
Talk to me. Please, talk to me...
Talk to me!
I'm so lonely...
Help me...
Oh my God!
They're alive! These dolls are alive!
You bastard! They're souls!
My hobby is to make dolls.
And I've had real souls inhabit these dolls.
I'm letting the cat out of the bag, but this is my Stand's power.
My brother simply enjoyed his soul coins, collected in little rows.
But that's rather simple and mundane.
I change their clothes and even talk to them.
D'Arby! Oh, D'Arby!
I love hearing about her beautiful love stories.
D'Arby...
Isn't her skin beautiful?
D'Arby...
She's so beautiful, I'm never embarrassed to show her off.
Dr. Elliott is a murderer. He's killed eight people.
I enjoy hearing about the patients he murdered.
I made his glasses and stethoscope myself.
Oh, that's right! I must show you this!
The video game master from Japan, Tatsuhiko!
His IQ is 190, so he was formidable.
It wasn't easy to beat him and steal his soul.
Mama... Mama! Mama!
Both of you brothers are insane.
You're pissing me off more!
You act like a gentleman, but you're scum.
You make me sick.
By the way, I'm sure you experienced this when fighting my brother, but...
Human souls are indeed mysterious.
Once you admit defeat, your soul's energy drops almost to zero.
I watch for that moment, and then drag their souls out!
That is how both my brother and my Stands work.
That's enough talk! You're just pissing me off.
We'll hurry up and defeat you, then move forward!
But you must listen!
Jotaro, you know you are already under my control.
Earlier, Jotaro, when I read whether you were
And how I read it is still a mystery to you.
At that moment, though subtly, I was able to touch your soul.
What do you think I did when I touched it?
Bam
Wh-What?!
What is that?!
I left Atum's arm attached to your soul.
and would be utterly defeated.
I don't want that to happen.
So how about this, gentlemen?
Why don't we play a little game and wager our souls?
What?
If I admit absolute defeat, I shall let go of his arm.
Good grief. Already under your control, huh?
True... But you're going to regret tricking me, D'Arby.
"I will play a game and wager my soul."
But the first to play will be...
Kakyoin. I choose you.
Hey, what's the meaning of this?
You should fight me first.
You're so full of yourself.
Very well. I shall be your first opponent.
What?
Kakyoin!
It's fine. I feel confident.
I have experience with video games myself.
I'd like to challenge you to .
And I shall wager my soul!
Atum
D'Arby Younger
I shall wager my soul!
Good.
Kakyoin!
You don't have to go first.
Yes, I do.
it's likely you'd mess up the game's controls.
D'Arby, where is our guarantee
Menacing
There's nothing wrong with the TV, console, or game cartridges.
These are the same video games you could find anywhere else.
I am not like my brother. I shall not cheat.
Now, let's begin.
Yes.
F-Mega!
Select your car.
First, please select your car.
Right.
So your machine is #28, eh?
Are you ready?
Enough pleasantries. Just go!
Race start in...
Th-The way he's pushing the accel button over
He's trying for a start dash!
Three...
Crap! I'm not going to be able to dash like this!
Two...
He's going to get ahead of me!
One.
Start!
He blocked me!
As long as I can keep this up, I will win.
It is impossible to get past me at this point.
And sadly, I, D'Arby, never make mistakes with controls in a race.
You were naïve, Kakyoin!
What?!
I see you've played this game before, Kakyoin.
I don't need to answer that.
All right!
This is your chance, Kakyoin!
Hurry up! Get your machine back on the course and start!
That technique...
he has a very bold personality.
They're tied! They're right next to each other!
No. Kakyoin ended up on the outside.
If they hit a curve side by side, the outside car is at a disadvantage.
355 kilometers per hour... 358... 360...
Only three seconds to the first corner!
It's possible to take the corner at this speed!
I'm going to bust through that corner at full throttle!
Two... One!
At the same time!
I've taken a liking to you, Kakyoin!
You wagered your soul, but you're not scared at all!
You rise above fear to work the controls.
Noriaki Kakyoin thought to himself...
Me? Rise above fear?
Six months ago, when I met your master, DIO...
That moment...
The moment I encountered DIO, honestly, I was terrified of the beast he was.
the paralysis made my hairs stand even more on end.
My stomach convulsed, and I had acid reflux.
I nearly threw up.
As he looked at me, DIO said this to me.
His voice was gentle, as if speaking to a child.
Kakyoin.
Let's be friends.
I curse myself! After I heard that...
I thought I could stay alive!
But it was humiliating. I can't forgive myself!
Nothing could be more humiliating.
I couldn't forgive myself.
I cursed myself for giving in to him.
Jotaro saved me, and that was the reason I went on this journey.
I will never return to being that pathetic Kakyoin ever again!
D'Arby, that's exactly why I'm wagering my soul with you in this challenge.
Three, two, one!
Again, at the same time!
The third corner!
will not make any nervous mistakes with my controls.
I will show you that!
All right! The fifth corner! Again, at the same time!
They're going through all of them the same time!
K-Kakyoin... Damn you...
Next is the sixth corner!
Once you're through the sixth corner, you'll see a speed tunnel.
No matter what, I must go through that tunnel!
But the tunnel is only wide enough to accommodate one vehicle.
one of them won't be able to enter the tunnel!
The sixth corner! Again, they were together!
The tunnel! I see the tunnel.
Kakyoin, don't let him push you out!
It seems you haven't realized yet, Kakyoin.
Are you trying to push me out?
Take a look at your #28's remaining power.
K-Kakyoin has less!
Didn't you realize you had less energy after that?
Two seconds until the tunnel.
You're going to collide! Let him have the lead!
Go into the tunnel after D'Arby!
I cannot!
One second until the tunnel!
Kakyoin!
Grip
Whoa! He tilted his car!
I never guessed you'd enter on the tunnel's wall.
Y-You did it, Kakyoin! Mentally, you're winning!
Keep pushing through!
Shut up! You're distracting me.
He's ramming him!
I don't care how little power I have left.
and get through this tunnel even if it's but a moment faster!
No radar.
H-Hey, what's wrong? I can't see the machines!
We have to get through the tunnel in darkness from here.
What?!
Absolute darkness, where the radar is completely useless!
There are eight curves, one mine, and one cannon.
At the end of the darkness is the tunnel's exit.
One mistake and you'll hit the wall.
But my body has memorized the timing needed to take the curves.
So has D'Arby.
That's the sound of taking a corner.
What's going on?! Where are they driving?
Three...
Two...
One!
Cannon!
Kakyoin is just slightly behind.
I can see the exit! They're coming out of the tunnel!
Gulp!
D'Arby is ahead!
He's ahead by a length!
I have won!
Next Episode Preview
I will never let down my guard.
You have less power than I!
I've grasped his soul!
Don't be ridiculous, Jotaro!
I know the rules of baseball.
It is impossible to back out now!
You should offer encouragement at times like this.

They're coming out of the tunnel!
Oh! D'Arby is ahead!
He's ahead by a car length!
My speed will be doubled.
I have won!
No!
Which means...
Kakyoin's #28...
spun and knocked D'Arby's car off the course!
And it was going at 850 kilometers per hour!
He's out of the course!
Kakyoin's #28 safely landed.
Yes!
The one with less power goes flying.
It seems you were wrong to think that losing power wouldn't matter.
so I could knock you off the course.
Really?
It's you who didn't realize.
Losing power was all part of my plan.
I lost power on purpose so you'd push my car off the course!
This battle isn't over yet!
Look at the direction my machine is flying!
What?!
I-It flew over the curve and landed further ahead on the course!
I-Impossible!
That's right. Normally, it's impossible.
Even at 850 kilometers per hour, once you're off the course, you crash into the ground.
You could never reach the next part of the course.
But Kakyoin, if you were to slam into me, it would become possible.
I just needed you to send me flying!
It was all part of my plan to reduce my power, then have you hit me.
Now, then...
Shall we continue the race, Kakyoin?
Don't admit defeat, Kakyoin!
Kakyoin!
I now hold his soul in my hands.
He has just admitted defeat.
He admitted within his heart that it was pointless to continue this race.
But Kakyoin, you are the first to ever make me sweat like this.
This doll is now an especially valuable part of my collection.
He is the first opponent to
K-Kakyoin!
I shall treasure it, and take very good care of it.
Now, now.
No, not just attacking me.
Kakyoin's soul would pass on to the realm beyond this life.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
J-Jotaro?
Oh?
Hey, Jotaro! Why are you sitting down?
I'll defeat him! I'm next!
Old man, have you played any one of these games more than Kakyoin has?
Stay out of this, old man.
This isn't like playing cards or hanafuda.
Next is baseball.
I want you to play this baseball game with me.
I'll wager my soul.
Good. And I shall wager Kakyoin's.
I have retrieved my Stand Atum's arm from your arm.
It would put my Stand at a disadvantage
to fight you with only one arm.
Your Star Platinum's movements are extremely fast and super precise.
But to think that you'd pick this baseball game...
This is the game I'm best at.
D'Arby! As soon as you lose to Jotaro, I will finish you.
Kaboom
Oh! That's A Baseball!
There is no trickery in this game.
First, please pick your team.
The Jaguars.
Jaguars!
I see.
Two of your players have batting averages over .400.
Then I shall choose the Red Dragons.
Red Dragons!
Would you like to bat first or second? Take your pick.
First.
Very well. The Jaguars are up first.
You can draw your own characters to input as the players.
This is Star Platinum.
Input. Now, let us play ball!
Jaguars versus Red Dragons.
Play ball!
Top of the 1st
I've chosen #15 to be my pitcher, since I was born on January 5th.
Here I go.
The pitcher is winding up.
The first pitch!
What?!
Strike!
H-Hey, Jotaro. What did you just do?
You swung the bat before the ball even left the pitcher's hand!
H-Hey, Jotaro... Why do you keep taking practice swings?
Don't tell me... Could it be that you...
have you ever played video game before?
Answer me, Jotaro!
Whatever. I know the rules for baseball.
I'll figure out the controls as I go.
Wh-What?!
That ridiculous, terribly-timed swing!
This is your first time playing game, isn't it?!
Strike two!
This time, you swung the bat after the ball hit the mitt!
God damn it, Jotaro!
You've never played a video game before, have you?!
Strike! Batter out!
Stop messing around, Jotaro!
Why are you putting on that attitude?!
You wagered your own soul! You can't back out now!
Good grief.
You should be supportive at times like this.
"It's just the first inning. You've only just started.
What are you thinking?
did you think you could beat him with no knowledge of video games at all?
What are you thinking, Jotaro?
What on Earth are you thinking?!
Jotaro...
No matter the situation, I never let down my guard.
Old man.
I'm not thinking about anything.
Except...
I'm only seriously thinking about getting Kakyoin's soul back.
You can say what you'd like...
But it's still the top of the first inning with one out.
Let us continue the game.
Please don't forget that if one of us
Second batter, #3.
Strike!
Th-This can't be happening!
This time, the ball was at least 40 centimeters away
Strike two!
Not even close!
Strike! Batter out!
It's no use.
It's too pathetic.
Strike!
Strike two!
It seems he truly is an amateur. He's too weak!
I think I now understand how a judo master feels
When it comes to video games, Jotaro is indeed an amateur.
But I will never let my guard down.
I've memorized the weaknesses of all the batters in this game.
Next will be a low pitch to the outside.
I'll throw my ultimate screwball and strike out all three without a single run.
Top of the first, two outs, two strikes and no balls.
Here comes my next pitch.
Go ahead.
What? What did he just say?
"How to bat"? What?
Did he just say "pretty much learned"?
What is he talking about? What does he mean?!
What?!
Jotaro!
Good. This game is pretty fun.
H-Hey, don't tell me...
It's still going. The ball is still in the air!
What did he say just now?!
"I've pretty much learned how to bat now."
Learned? Did he just say learned?!
I-It's fair!
Y-You're kidding! You're kidding me!
Home run!
Home run! A home run!
Jotaro! You bastard!
Atum
D'Arby Younger
Jotaro!
What did you just say?
There's no reason for me to say it again.
He was, without a doubt, a beginner.
Is he saying that he managed to learn the controls by swinging eight times?
Jotaro Kujo has Star Platinum, who has the power of super precise movement.
Now I know exactly why
Interesting. This is how my opponents should be.
And you exposed this fearsome
You'll eventually regret that.
Let us continue the game, Jotaro.
He did it!
It's fair! It's fair!
He got another home run!
Now it's four to nothing in the top of the first.
Looks like you've got the hang of this game, Jotaro.
Keep this up! Keep it up!
Hey, D'Arby.
Menacing
we'll spare your life.
and a master at cheating.
Yet he never said to me, "Brother, why don't we play a game of poker?"
Not even once.
Do you know why that is?
When I was fifteen, my brother hit on my girlfriend.
I beat the shit out of him, even though he was ten years older.
I broke his ribs and kicked him until he vomited blood.
To that, all my brother had to say was, "I'm sorry."
Do you know why?
What are you getting at, you bastard?
My brother knew ever since we were children that he had no way of beating me.
He knew there was a reason he couldn't win.
And now, it appears as if Jotaro is getting excited and really taking off with this game.
However, he's uncertain, just like my brother was as a child.
He's uncertain about my abilities.
"Nah, it couldn't be. Or wait, maybe..." That's what he's been thinking.
Right, Jotaro?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm changing pitchers! I'll switch #15 for #77.
# Name G W L H S ERA
15) Starting Pitcher 55) Relief Pitcher 77) Closer 90) Relief Pitcher 84) Starting Pitcher
Number Position Games Wins Losses H S ERA
#77 is a fastball pitcher, whose fastest pitch clocks in at 165 kilometers per hour.
Number
5.23
And I will declare what kind of pitch he will throw.
#77 will now throw
Rumbling
What?! He just declared his pitch?
He will throw a forkball right down the middle.
Will you believe me or not?
Jotaro, he's just playing mind games with you.
Throw, D'Arby.
Will you believe me or not?
Here it comes! It's coming straight down the middle!
It's a straight!
But is it going to remain a straight?!
Will it fall or not?
He swung! Jotaro bet on the forkball!
But it's not falling! It's staying straight!
He caught the bottom of the ball!
Out!
Top of the first, three outs! Change!
Top of the 1st
How could you be so stupid?!
and swung for a forkball!
No.
As he said, ever since we entered this mansion, I've been uncertain.
He somehow knew that Star Platinum would throw a right punch.
I-Impossible! So are you telling me
that he's reading your mind?
Next is the bottom of the first. It's my turn on offense.
This is a declaration that I will hit a home run.
I shall hit the ball you throw into the left stands.
Old man. You're certain that the game
There's no chance of that.
And I've been keeping my eye out for any kind of cheating.
That means the secret lies with his Stand.
It doesn't just take souls.
The course of action I'll take is...
This should tell me something.
What?! He's going to try to hit the batter on purpose?
Where might you be aiming to throw? Inside?
Will it be high?
Or low?
Are you planning some sort of trick?
What?! He dodged at the same time as the pitch was thrown!
Bazoom
H-He read that! He perfectly read it!
There's no way he could have done that without reading Jotaro's mind.
Home run!
That's one run.
I-Impossible.
If it can read minds, then will no amount of intelligence or power
s-stand any chance against it?
Wh-What are you going to do, Jotaro?!
Bottom of the 1st
Bam
Damn it! H-He's declaring another home run.
Will the next one be outside?
And low?
Or will it be a straight?
Clang
Home run!
Four to two.
you can figure out how an opponent's mind works, to an extent.
But this Stand can anticipate the ball's course with perfect precision.
And he's not cheating!
Another home run! It's four to three!
How can we stop him from reading our minds?
I'm going to turn this around soon.
Now, will the next one be inside?
Down the middle? High? A changeup?
I wonder where it'll go.
Your hat...
Heh, you fool.
Jotaro, that's not it!
He's not reading the reflection of the screen in your eyes.
And it's not a trick where he's listening to your fingers
I've been watching him. That's not what's going on.
This is the first time I've sweat or bled in a while.
I'd like you to hurry up and throw your next pitch.
But I don't think I have to worry about sweating anymore.
I'm going to declare my pitch.
It's going to be a straight, high to the outside.
What?
Wh-What? What did you just say, Jotaro?!
You heard me.
Menacing
I said I was going to declare my pitch.
I'll throw a straight, high to the outside.
Jotaro!
Menacing
Will you believe me or not?
Are you stupid?
Next Episode Preview
What did you just say, Jotaro?!
I said I was going to declare my pitch.
Jotaro is not lying.
Yes.
You rigged the console somehow!
No.
Your school hat proves that you're cheating!
It's not cheating if you don't get caught.

I said I was going to declare my pitch.
I'll throw a straight, high to the outside.
Jotaro!
Will you believe me or not?
Are you stupid?
Vrrrr
My Stand can see my opponent's soul, as if with night vision.
No matter who a person might be, the soul does not lie.
Yes or no? Right or left?
When the question is asked, I know what they will choose.
Outside or inside? High or low?
A change-up or a straight?
I can know the answer 100% of the time.

A straight, high to the outside?
Yes or no?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Jotaro is not lying. A straight, high to the outside...
He's really going to throw that.
What's he trying to do?
but does he actually think he can intimidate me?
What a fool.
I'm pitching.
Don't forget that the game will be called once there's an 11-point difference.
Curve
What?! It was a change-up!
And it's a hit!
I-Impossible.
he couldn't possibly control his own soul like that.
I'm going with a high straight to the outside again.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
O-Once again, he's not lying. He's serious!
Jotaro... You're not cheating, are you?
I do! I do! I do! I do!
What?!
He is cheating?!
A forkball, low to the inside!
Pop-up fly to the pitcher.
Out!
You cheated... Jotaro, you bastard!
You rigged the console somehow!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
What?
It's not rigged?
I know that you're cheating!
What kind of trick is it?
H-He's not responding.
Damn it! The question has to be a yes or no question!
It seems your mind-reading questions can only be answered with a yes or no.
Your brother liked to say this...
It's not cheating if you don't get caught.
It's not cheating if you don't get caught?
How dare you speak like you know it all?! Who do you think you're talking to?!
Pitch, Jotaro!
I'll figure out your trick, and drag your soul out!
Now, then. Shall we continue?
My next pitch will be...
A straight, high and to the outside.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Jotaro's soul is not lying.
He's serious about throwing a high outside straight.
I'll figure it out! I'll figure it out!
I will figure out this trick!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
His soul's will hasn't changed.
It's still saying "yes." He's really going to throw that.
Here it comes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
It's still saying "yes." He threw a straight!
But it dropped! It's a forkball!
What?! It changed course!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Bottom of the 1st
Out! Three outs, change!
I don't understand! I don't know how he's cheating!
And yet the pitch changed!
Why?! Why the hell is that happening?!
I will defeat you, D'Arby.
Shut up!
The cheating started as soon as you took off your school cap!
Get up! I'm going to inspect your seat and controller.
I'm right, aren't I?!
No! No! No! No!
Your trick is somewhere around here, right?!
No! No! No! No!
You're using Star Platinum to cheat, aren't you?!
No! No! No! No!
You rigged something, didn't you, Jotaro?!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
God damn it! I... I can read people's souls!
I can read your soul, Jotaro!
But why are all the pitches different from my readings?!
He, uh... looks like he's aged a bit.
He doesn't look like a kid in his twenties anymore.
D'Arby, it's your turn to pitch.
Four to three...
I can win one run back in no time.
I'm a genius when it comes to games.
I'm a genius when it comes to games! There's no way I can lose!
My mind, too...
Schooled through many battles, it is invincible!
An expert at games is an expert at life!
I won't let this damage me!
It's in! It's a home run!
The Jaguars score their fifth run!
It's five to three!
Sh-Shit! I accidentally let go of his soul!
Kakyoin's soul and consciousness have returned!
N-No! No! I haven't admitted defeat!
It was an accident! I let go of his soul by accident!
If his soul was set free, that means that your own soul
has admitted defeat.
What?!
J-Joseph's Stand... It's coming out of the controller.
O-Oh, whoops.
S-Something so stupid...
It wasn't Jotaro controlling it, but you, Joseph Joestar!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
That's right, D'Arby.
Bam
By the way, old man.
I'm glad you caught on to my idea without a signal.
Of course I can tell what you're thinking!
You're my grandson.
Snap out of it, Kakyoin.
D-Damn it... From behind...
Now, then.
All that's left is to dispose of him.
P-Please forgive me! I gave you Kakyoin's soul back!
Everything's back to normal now!
Forgive me, please? Please? Please?
No! No! No! No! No!
Here's a question. Will I hit you with my right fist or my left?
P-Please, just hit me quickly with your right.
No! No! No! No! No!
Y-Your left?
No! No! No! No! No!
I-Is it both?!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Are you going to do the "ora ora" thing?!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh my God!
D'Arby Younger Unable to Recover (Must Retire)
D'Arby Younger has retired.
Looks like we broke through some sort of wall.
We can get out there, Jotaro! Kakyoin!
Good grief.
Forgive me for interrupting your rest.
Joestar and his party infiltrated the mansion.
Also, I must report that D'Arby has fallen.
D'Arby was a genius.
Why do you think D'Arby lost, despite having the ability to win?
Come in, Cool Ice.
Pardon me.
The Joestars truly believe, from the bottom of their hearts, that they are willing
to throw away their own lives to save
Kakyoin and the other two...
Hmm...
Right. Avdol and Polnareff have also decided
It appears they think that
How truly foolish.
But it seems that foolish notion is important to them.
That's why he wasn't able to win in the end.
D'Arby will never know why he lost.
Ice...
Ice...
Yes. With pleasure.
Please accept this!
You removed your own head...
But Cool Ice...
I cannot accept blood from someone of your caliber.
I shall heal my wound with another's blood.
There's no need for you to die.
Return to life with my blood.
I have no doubt that you will triumph.
Lord DIO...
It truly is best to have your own body.
It's immediately compatible.
I will leave them to you, Cool Ice.
Lord DIO...
I shall eliminate them all, without fail.
Open the door if you're going to leave.
Cool Ice
The ten minutes we promised them have passed.
but let us enter the mansion instead.
Yeah.
Polnareff, before we go in, there's something I'd like to say.
I do not plan to help you.
The same goes for you, Iggy.
Promise me that even if I am defeated
You must think of your own safety first.
We cannot allow all of us to be defeated as we try to save one another.
Yeah, I got it, Avdol.
If we get out of here alive, you'd better treat me to a fancy dinner.
And Iggy, too.
All right, let's go in.
Silver Chariot!
Hey, Avdol. What do we do?
More importantly...
Magician's Red!
This flame detects lifeforms.
It can also sense another Stand's energy.
Let us observe it as we navigate this maze.
Why are there six flames linked together?
Each one points to the front, back, left, right, up, and down, respectively.
Mr. Joestar and the others were dragged underground.
The flame has already picked up something.
What?!
The Fool!
Hey, hey. Wh-Who the hell is that guy?!
Look around us, Polnareff!
Huh?!
It appears he was the Stand user that created that illusion.
It was instantaneous, but Iggy defeated him.
Name: Billie Jean Stand Power: Illusions Retired without a fight
His name was Billie Jean, and he was retired without even a fight!
So the mansion has been restored to its normal state.
The flames aren't picking up any signs of life.
After you see this writing and turn around, you will...
After you see this writing and turn around, you will... die.
There is no change in the flames.
Wh-What is that?!
Impossible! Iggy's nose and my flames didn't sense him at all!
He appeared out of nowhere!
Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!
H-Hey, Avdol! Where are you?
Wh-What are th-those arms...?
H-Hey, Avdol!
Where'd you go?!
Avdol!
Where are you?!
Avdol!
Avdol!
Wh-What the hell is that?
Why didn't Avdol's flames sense him?
Hey, Iggy!
Where are you, Avdol?!
Where did you go?!
Avdol...
has been disintegrated. He is dead.
but it is a dimension of darkness.
I sent him there.
I must correct your arrogant belief that you can defeat Lord DIO.
One by one... In order, in order...
I shall scatter you throughout my dimension of darkness.
You're lying...
Saying that...
Don't lie to me!
Next Episode Preview
Is fate telling me to live on?
I heard another wall fall down.
More sounds of destruction?
He's full of spite.
I will eliminate you.
Don't let his spite overcome you!
There's no time to deal with the pain...
Suck on my sword and die!

Could it be Avdol and Polnareff?
Damn it! I know I hit him, b-but he's not dead...
They suddenly shrank and disappeared into their dimension.
The user and the Stand both...
Avdol... God damn it.
You're... You're the one who said...
Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!
You said if something happened, we had to think of ourselves first.
You said you wouldn't save me.
Ever since India, all you've done is meddle in other people's problems!
Avdol! You should have just left me alone!
If I hadn't crouched down just then, I would have been killed.
Is fate telling me to live on?
Is Avdol's will telling me to fight?
It's too dangerous to stay in this room.
Grar
Up there, Iggy!
Go upstairs! Up those stairs!
That's the exit! That's the door we came in.
But we can't go out that way.
Avdol sacrificed himself to save us.
Because he believed that we could defeat DIO.
I can't betray the trust of someone like that!
Running away now is what a loser would do.
I'm not running away.
I'm running to get to that bastard, DIO!
Let's run straight to him!
And I thought they'd go for the exit. So close...
I'm impressed that he managed to injure me.
It is indeed true that Polnareff
Without a doubt, I will corner and kill him. Without a doubt...
My Stand is far stronger than he is.
The inside of his Stand's mouth is a dimension of darkness?!
but it lets him get close without any sounds, smells, or other signs of life.
But how...
How am I supposed to beat that guy?
H-He cut us off!
He's nearby.
He's here!
Iggy, watch my back!
I'll watch yours.
He can't come through without breaking a hole in the wall.
What I do know is that
Come at me, damn it! I'll cut you in half!
Right now, my Chariot is incredibly fast.
Because of how angry I am at losing Avdol!
What?! H-He's in the crack under my foot?!
Chario—
Grar
My foot!
so you won't be able to run around or escape!
Bastard!
Whoa, there.
Mr. Joestar! The sound of another wall breaking!
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
Avdol and the others are in this mansion, and they're fighting.
Hurry! We have to find them!
You managed to hide during the confusion, Polnareff.
But it's no use.
You're probably under some rubble nearby.
You are powerless before me. Without a doubt, I will defeat you.
Now, where are you, Polnareff?
What's all this noise, Cool Ice?
L-Lord DIO!
Please be careful!
Please leave this to me.
The fake DIO we made using The Fool tricked him.
but since that's how you killed Avdol, I don't feel even a shred of pity!
It's exactly how you deserve to die!
Do it, Iggy!
Cream
Cool Ice
Do it, Iggy!
No! Damn it!
Sunlight streams through this room's windows.
The real Lord DIO would never
leave his room to enter this place.
Iggy!
The real Lord DIO told me he trusts me, and that he would leave this to me!
So, no matter what happens, he would never descend to this second floor!
Shit! He's going to kill Iggy!
You shitty little mutt! How dare you?!
Wh-What the hell? He punched him!
He didn't use his dimension of darkness!
He punched Iggy across the room without killing him!
Of all things...
how dare you make me strike him?!
I'll kick you to death, you bastard!
It takes but an instant to be swallowed by my dimension of darkness!
That is not enough time for my anger to wane!
This is all your fault! You!
You're the one who has angered me!
Learn your lesson!
How's that?! Learn your lesson! How's that? How's that?!
S-Stop...
Cool Ice isn't right in the head.
This is overkill.
He's mad that he had to attack DIO's image?
His mind itself is the dimension of darkness!
His mind is the black abyss that rips everything apart!
Lord DIO said
that we cannot underestimate the power of human resolve.
But you're no more than a filthy dog!
You don't have resolve, or a proud soul, or anything like it!
Stop...
How's that? And that?
Stop...
How's that? And that?!
Stop it, Cool Ice!
Bam
I will end this, Polnareff!
Damn it!
He disappeared!
But...
Iggy!
but your sand gave me a hint.
I've figured out a way to read his movements!
I can see him.
Serves you right! I've got you!
You bastard!
So swallow this! Swallow the sand and head this way, you shithead!
And when your rotten, stinking mouth appears, that's when
you're going to crumble!
I hit him head-on! Hell yeah!
appears when you try to confirm my location.
Suck on that!
Y-You bastard...
Hurry up and die! You're mortally wounded!
Just hurry up and die!
Die, Cool Ice!
I will not die.
Whatever it takes, I will kill you!
Whatever it takes, I will swallow up Iggy and kill Joestar and the others!
I can die after that!
You bastard!
A wise move. You've pulled your sword free.
This time, I send you to hell!
Is this the vile arm that stabbed me?
You bastard...
Damn it! I had no choice but to shove him away!
Shit!
Oh, no, you don't!
I cut it! B-But this isn't good...
Grar
Damn it! He got my leg. I can't move.
But I don't have time to think about pain, either.
And I was so close to finishing him, too!
This guy is just...
He's obsessive!
He's crazy, but he's completely obsessive about serving DIO!
I can't let that overwhelm me!
I can't die until I kill you, either!
That bastard! Here he comes!
Take this!
Grar
I-It's no use. I cut him, but he swallowed the tip of my sword!
It's impossible to attack him when he's in his dimension of darkness.
I'm just going to get being swallowed up.
He's swallowing up everything in his path. God damn it!
He's got good instincts.
D-Damn it... Iggy's losing blood like crazy.
A bunch of broken bones are piercing his lungs...
Talk about reckless... The walls are disappearing.
N-No... I had the wrong idea!
This isn't instinct. His moves are calculated!
and the circles keep getting smaller.
He's on a path like a cyclone...
No, like a mosquito repellent coil, closing in on me!
Even if he doesn't show up
I'm caught in his trap.
A-Am I going to be able to dodge him with this leg?
I-I've got to dig through the floor and get away.
It's no use. I don't have enough time!
He's coming at me!
I somehow managed to dodge...
Now, here's the question...
How am I going to dodge when I have this hole in my leg?

would show up in the next couple of seconds
like American comic book heroes—ta-da!—
and save me at the last minute.
For all I know, Mr. Joestar and the others
Looks like answer #1 is the only option.
Chariot! Pull me out of the circle as hard as you can!
Damn it! Pull me faster!
I-It's no use!
Despair! The answer he's been left with is #3.
Answer #3
Reality is cruel.
My Silver Chariot is a Stand that cuts things with a sword.
Now that I'm so badly injured, it doesn't have the power to pull my weight.
Damn it...
You wreck! Keep still, you idiot!
What are you trying to act all tough for, you idiot?!
Are you trying to save me so you can die along with me?
I'm the one who's going to look cool saving you!
You have to survive and warn Mr. Joestar and the others about this bastard.
The important thing is to defeat him!
Avdol saved me, but you don't need to save me, too!
If we all die, it's over!
One more time around, and he'll come right to me.
The answer is #3.
Looks like his obsession... wins.
So long, Iggy.
Next Episode Preview
This blood is not your doing.
It is Avdol's.
I don't know the details.
I have really bad luck with friends...
Not to the likes of you!
It happens every time. I only realize it after they're gone...
Episode 44
The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 3
-Tibet, 1863-
You have endured our training for three long years.
You can run for dozens of miles without losing your breath.
You will soon be ready for the training we call the Celestial Gate.
However, I tell you again, Zeppeli...
...if you continue your training, you will not be able to escape your doom.
The time for turning back is now. You can still start a new life.
Master Tonpetty...
...please read the waves of my life once more.
When am I destined to die? Where am I destined to die?
What would you do if you knew?
I have a purpose in my life. I cannot set it aside.
I want to know in order to fulfill that purpose.
I will accept everything when I know when I will die.
I will be satisfied.
Very well, if you feel you are prepared...
...I will tell you.
In an ancient, hidden chamber that reeks of death...
...a child will open the way.
In order to release a chained young lion into the future...
...you will burn your own wounds and after, a cruel death awaits you!
Baron Zeppeli...
Be careful, Baron!
Here I come, JoJo!
In order to release a chained young lion into the future.
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 7: The Inheritor
This collar won't budge!
And Tarukus hasn't shown off any of his
That worries me.
Come, fools! You want to hit me with some of your Hamon?
You cowards won't be able to lay a finger on me!
What's the matter? Scared stiff?
Well done, Baron Zeppeli!
Try this, Tarukus!
Tornado Overdrive!
H-He just...!
Above me?
No, the chain is coming from below!
You're both right!
I call this the Hell Heaven Snake Kill!
I'll strangle you both to death!
I-I can't breathe.
My Hamon won't...
Jo...
JoJo...
Lord Dio, I have executed both of them as you ordered.
Th-This is...
This is just too cruel!
Jonathan!
Still alive, even with a broken neck, are you?
Allow me to finish you.
Jo...
JoJo...
The other one is still alive, too?
My ultimate...
My ultimate...
My ultimate technique is now yours, JoJo!
JoJo, please, take up my torch!
Ultimate Deep Pass Overdrive!
JoJo, I have given you all of my life energy.
B-Baron...
B-Baron Zeppeli!
I'll grind both of you into paste beneath my boot!
Y-You...
Jonathan pulled Tarukus off the ground!
Baron Zeppeli's Hamon healed his broken neck!
Idiot, you think you can yank that open? You, a pathetic human?
I couldn't pull apart that steel
You'll pay, Tarukus!
Jonathan!
W-What the...?!
You are utterly twisted by your madness. 
S-Such strength! His body can barely contain his power!
Jonathan received Baron Zeppeli's power
Tarukus, I will allow nothing of you to remain in this world.
I will banish your evil spirit!
Drown in the depths of history!
Enough talk, you little brat!
Your little trick didn't work!
It's over!
Baron Zeppeli!
Baron Zeppeli...
I can't...
I can't believe this.
Without you...
Without you, what will we do?
JoJo, you fool! Have you lost your wits?
This is no time to grieve!
Now...
Now you are...
Now go.
Defeat Dio.
Destroy the mask.
Baron Zeppeli!
I...
I am satisfied with my fate.
When I was young, I was married.
But I abandoned my family to pursue the mask.
Even so, I am satisfied with my fate.
I accept it completely.
In the end, I passed along all of myself.
JoJo...
...you are my hope.
Baron Zeppeli...
You feel like both a son and a best friend to me.
And now I will live on...
...within you.
The 19th century novelist William Thackeray wrote this:
To love and win is the best thing.
To love and lose is the next best.
So JoJo took up his mentor's life's quest as well as his spirit.
Farewell, Baron Zeppeli.
P-Please...
Please spare the life of this child.
Let me confirm your desire, madam.
You will give your life to us, but we must not touch your child.
Is that right?
Please, leave my child alone.
You move me to tears. Okay.
I, Dio, swear that
However, all of them bowed to their fear
It would be better for both you and your child to join us.
You would have no worries. There would be no hate between you.
Please, just spare this child!
Just this child...
Okay, okay...
My sweet baby!
We won't harm the child, as I promised.
Instead you do it yourself.
It is a tragedy of your own choosing.
Jonathan's expression has changed.
His face is darker.
And I am the same.
We must endure our sadness and anger.
We cannot grieve until Dio has fallen!
Jonathan, Dio said he would wipe out the town in one more night!
Zombies will create zombies, breeding like rats!
What is happening down there?
Is Wind Knights Lot still alive?
Is my sister all right?
Let's hurry.
Mr. Adams!
Poco, why are you wandering about at this hour?!
Mr. Adams, is Sis all right? Is the town all right?
Is she all right?!
You really think she's all right?!
She's furious!
I guess the town is safe.
Let's move!
Thanks, Mr. Adams!
A child!
I want to drink the fresh, warm blood of a child!
He's already been turned!
Can you escape this speed?!
It looks like it is too late.
That's correct.
The outskirts are infested with zombies.
Another one?!
My name is Dire.
A kick, but why so slow?
Try this! Thunder Split Attack!
H-He's incredible!
A normal man would pull his head back, but he head-butted me instead!
Wait, Jonathan Joestar!
I am human.
Forgive me.
I wanted to see how well Zeppeli has trained you.
Did you say Zeppeli?!
I did. He is a dear friend who has been
Indeed.
I am Straizo.
Look at this.
A letter...
It's from...
...Baron Zeppeli!
He sent that letter to request our aid.
He wrote about the location of the mask
This is our master, Tonpetty.
A pleasure to meet you.
You're Baron Zeppeli's teacher, Master Tonpetty.
Where I come from, shaking hands is not a custom.
We greet each other this way.
And where is Zeppeli now?
I see. Zeppeli has passed.
Even if we had come earlier, his fate would not have changed.
But this Dio's power is overwhelming!
His wicked might is quite extraordinary.
This town is now mine and it took less than a single night.

You fell for it, fool!
I will show you no mercy!
I'll feel no guilt for killing you!

Wh... What are these remnants of destruction?
It's a perfectly round opening, like someone pulled out a cork.
Wh-What is it...?
The destruction continues on beyond this room.
These are clearly signs that Avdol and the others encountered an enemy.
Jotaro! Break down this door! We're going in!
Yeah.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Polnareff. It is not by your hand that I bleed.
It is by Avdol's.
but he knocked you out of the way.
This blood is the result of that.
But although I am injured, it will take some time until I die.
I shall go finish off Joestar and the other two!
I will, without a doubt, eliminate them.
Iggy... I told you over and over not to use your Stand...
Trying to act all cool and shit...
I told you so many times.
Polnareff!
Cool Ice said that a mere dog could not have resolve.
That he could not possess a proud soul.
But Stands are the soul's manifestation.
Iggy's soul had moved on its own.
It had no choice but to move.
Th-This feeling in the sand...
How could this have happened? Damn it!
It's an empty shell. A Stand's empty shell...
This is cold annihilation... The destruction of life.
Damn it! I'm the one who survived!
Ig...
Iggy!
You're too slow, Cool Ice. And you're exactly right.
I have really bad luck when it comes to friends.
I was supposed to save Iggy, but instead, he saved me.
Damn it...
I just realized how much I liked him.
It always happens this way. I only understand after they're gone.
I realize now that your refusal to show
affection for anyone proved just how proud you really were.
I told you not to save me...
Damn it! It's because of your stubbornness that...
Rumble
I knew it. Cool Ice, you bastard...
I thought it was strange.
You're immortal. DIO did something to you, didn't he?
Wh-What... i-is... this?!
You didn't notice your body changing?
You received his blood, didn't you?
You're the same as DIO.
A soulless, filthy vampire!
You bastard!
Looks like you started to turn into a vampire
Go on.
You're obsessed with protecting DIO, aren't you?
Come at me! I'm right here!
What's wrong, Cool Ice? Come on!
You will not...
Go to Hell.
A-Avdol... I-Iggy!
W...
Or...
Either way, I have to climb up those stairs
I don't have time to cry in sadness now.
Avdol has died Iggy has died

It has now been 43 days since Jojo and the others departed.
Stop for a moment, Rosas.
Please, stop the car.
Soba Soba Midokoro
Madam, you're not thinking about stopping at that soba stand, are you?
Indeed I am!
I'm going to have a bite before I go see my daughter.
You hold my little turtle for me.
You mustn't, Madam!
You are Madam Joestar.
Oh, hush. I'm going to record a commemorative video.
Very good! Very good!
Soba
Do not puke or piss
Mr. Rosas.
Have you not told her about her daughter Holly's condition?
Hurry it up, Rosas! Come, come!
I-I'll be right there...
I... I haven't told her yet.
She came to Japan thinking
ever since Miss Holly was in grade school.
I know I should have told her the truth.
But... I lacked the courage.
So we arrived in Japan before I could tell her.
Miss Holly's strength has run out.
I could tell her, if you'd like.
N-No... I have lied this long to Madam about Miss Holly.
Hiring Part-timers
I will tell her myself.
Is it true that she might be cured if
Yes. he is defeated.
By the evil energy of the man known as DIO...
The Madam cannot see Stands.
You must go tell Madam Joestar right away.
Sh-Shadow of death?
Come, Rosas! What are you doing?
You should have some curry udon, too.
Madam, there's something I must tell you...
Oh! I must get some footage of the

Good. Very good. Would you like one, Rosas?
Madam, please stop! Those are not drinks!
P-Please listen, Madam!
Oh? To what?
Th-The truth is, Miss Holly...
This Japanese person is so unique and cool!
Hello, hello, give me smile!
What the hell?
Gah!
Yay!
Come back here, damn it! Are you messing with me?!
Hand over that camera!
Who the hell do you think you are, you foreign granny?!
Want to see some blood, you shitty old woman? Huh?
Hey, that's quite enough.
Kabam
Madam, please! Learn a bit more about Japan.
Okay.
I-I couldn't tell her
I can't bear seeing Madam in shock and sadness.
We've come this far before I could tell her.
The Kujo household is almost in sight.
I must tell her now...
I must be the one to tell her!
Rosas.
I already know what's been troubling you.
My daughter's life is in danger, isn't it?
When I called her from New York, Holly always sounded cheerful and strong.
She said that she just had a little cold.
But somehow I knew
that something terrible was happening to my daughter and my husband.
and I gave birth to my daughter, after all.
I was frightened.
Since we're discussing it now, we should tell you clearly.
Miss Holly's survival will depend upon these next few days.
Mr. Joestar and the others went to Egypt to address
but I have not heard any news from them yet.
P-Please forgive me for not telling you, Madam.
It was so cruel!
What nonsense are you speaking, Rosas?
There is just one thing we can do for Holly.
Holly.
Mom...
Rosas, listen carefully.
The one thing we can do for my daughter
is believe.
I do not know the details, but I have faith.
then I will believe in them.
he has never betrayed my expectations.
Believe in Jotaro and Joseph.
Get better, and we'll all be together as a family again.
Mom...
Madam... Miss Holly...
Star Platinum
Jotaro Kujo
Cool Ice... Billie Jean... D'Arby Younger...
All of you were fools after all!
Bam
I can't help but belly laugh in sheer satisfaction to think they got what they deserved!
Calling me "Nukesaku" like I'm some moron...
You're the dumbasses who got killed!
Nukesaku, it is impossible for you
Just stay out of it.
H-Hey... Let me in on the action, too.
You're nothing more than a vampire.
Just try and interfere. We'll kill you if you do.
Just stay put, Nukesaku.
I'll be the one who finishes off Jotaro!
Stop! There's something in front of us, to the right.
It's a woman...
P-Please spare me!
Don't drink my blood! Please don't drink my blood!
I'll do whatever you say! So please, spare my life!
H-Hey, just wait a second. Calm down.
I won't try to run away again! So please... spare my life!
Calm down!
You can consider us friends. We'll help you, so calm down.
Friends...
Will you really help me?
That's right. We're friends...
Crush
Of justice, that is.
That's right. We'll help you.
We'll help you go straight to Hell!
I-Impossible! Wh-Why? Why?!
How did you figure it out?!
Is your power having the face of a woman on the back of your head?
You should have at least turned your hands around.
Th-That's right!
Hey, Nukesaku.
Where's DIO's room? Tell us.
Jotaro, don't knock him out. Let's have him guide us.
Why, you...
You called me "Nukesaku"... Don't mess with me!
I'll kill you!
Oh? Did you just say you were immortal?
So you're a vampire like DIO...
Well, then, I guess I'll have to see just how immortal you are.
Oh my God!
it's still possible to cut you into pieces.
Come on. Lead us to DIO. The sun's setting.
Okay... But may I ask you one thing?
How did you know that they call me "Nukesaku"?
Good grief.
Those curtains were made of some nice cloth.
Now I can move better, and even jump.
Rumble
So it's you, Polnareff. It's been a while.
DIO.
You're here at last.
Next Episode Preview
So we finally meet, DIO.
I don't have fond memories of them.
I do not regret this journey.
I-I'll tell you everything that just happened.
Not good. Something here is not good!
When did he bring out that Stand?

DIO!
and managed to travel from the Far East to make it here.
If you want to give me a prize for that, how about you give me your life?
I shall give you a chance.
But if you'd rather die, then climb those stairs.
That was when I became a loser.
living with no desire but to do your bidding.
But right now, I don't feel any fear at all.
I feel only my will to fight.
this journey of 45 days and the death of my friends
have completely blown away my fear of you.
Is that so?
Then climb those stairs.
I see, Polnareff.
You've gone down the stairs, which means you wish to join me, DIO.
Wh-What?! I know I just took a step up...
What's the matter? You're losing your composure, Polnareff.
Doesn't one lose his composure when he is afraid?
but you're so terrified that your body
subconsciously did the opposite and went down?
Impossible! I know I went up the stairs!
Wh-What did he do?! Is it his Stand?
I-It can't be...
DIO's Stand...
Wh-What is...

Episode 45 DIO's World, Part 1
Polnareff, have you ever considered why humans wish to live?
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
and acquiring wealth are all done to achieve peace of mind.
Marriage and friendship are also pursued as means of attaining peace of mind.
or that a thing is done for love or justice...
It's all merely to give themselves peace of mind.
To achieve peace of mind is the goal of all mankind.
Now, given that, what anxiety could you possibly feel toward serving me?
Any other peace of mind will come easily if you do.
bring you anxiety?
I-It can't be! Am I subconsciously submitting to him?
You are a very capable Stand user.
It's a waste to kill you.
and serve me for eternity?
I can promise you peace of mind for eternity.
I can't go on like this...
Y-You talk too much, DIO!
I've already died once.
I won't die again until I figure out the identity of your Stand!
You leave me no choice.
Then you'll just have to die, Polnareff!
So that's The World? Bring it on!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
M-Mr. Joestar!
Don't worry, Polnareff.
DIO!
That was DIO, wasn't it?
We're going after him!
Before you go after him, let me say this.
I just experienced his Stand, just for a moment.
Actually, it wasn't so much an experience... It was completely beyond my understanding.
I-I'll tell you exactly what happened.
and I don't know what he did, either.
I thought I was going insane.
It wasn't anything simple, like hypnosis or super speed...
I experienced something much more terrifying.
Where are Avdol and Iggy?
Th-They didn't make it...
I see.
Mr. Joestar, the sun is setting.
You're right.
Hey, Nukesaku. What's above this floor?
A-A tower.
There is a single room at the very top.
Lord DIO stays there during the day.
Do any other staircases lead up to that tower?
N-No. These stairs are the only way.
All right. Lead the way.
So that's him.
The man we're about to face
Yes. I have always known him.
I've known him since the day I was born.
The same goes for Jotaro.
He's not someone we have fond memories of.
he was someone we would encounter one day, someone we must defeat.
I have no regrets.
The journey we've made, the events about to transpire...
I regret none of it.
What I'm feeling right now tells me the side I'm on is white.
DIO's side is black.
Mr. Joestar and the others, too, are white.
Despite my injuries, I can feel my courage growing.
I am on the white side, the side of righteousness!
Once he steps out of the coffin, we'll attack.
But be careful.
Nukesaku, open the lid.
L-Lord DIO, I promise, I did not betray you.
It's because I truly believe in your power that I led them here.
As certain as when you piss in a strong wind, it'll get on your pants!
Please understand!
Shut up and open it already!
Lord DIO!
He's going to come flying out!
Huh?
I-I was the one inside?!
Wh-What?! How?!
I never took my eyes off him!
Did any of you see the moment Nukesaku entered...
It's as Polnareff said! This is not merely a trick or super speed!
We're in danger.
Something here is truly dangerous!
Run!
D-Damn it!
What are you doing, Polnareff?
Damn it!
What in the world was that?
I didn't actually see it, but it felt much
It was like knowing a bulldozer is present from the sound of its engine alone.
I felt it, too. It was incredible murderous intent!
It felt like someone stuck an icicle up my ass!
If we had stayed in there, we would've been killed, one by one!
This is bad... This is extremely bad.
The sun's almost out of sight!
His time has come.
Don't tell me that we're
I'll telling you now, Mr. Joestar!
I agree with Polnareff.
I feel the same way, but the situation has changed.
you are guaranteed to get lost. Guaranteed!
It's as inevitable as belching after you drink a cola.
We know DIO will come after us.
We have to wait for that chance.
No! I can't run away!
Avdol and Iggy died for me!
but I will not run away!
Wait, Polnareff!
It's no use trying to stop him, old man.
Jotaro, tell us what you think we should do.
Polnareff is fighting him as he pursues him.
We'll fight him as we retreat.
we'll be in position for a pincer attack.
Hey, you there.
I want to buy that truck. Sell it to me.
What'd you say? I need this to do my job!
I'm flooring it, Kakyoin!
There you are, DIO!
Run away until sunrise? Like hell I can do that!
I'll finish you myself if I must!
there are still plenty of ways to beat you.
I'll assassinate you!
Don't do anything rash, Polnareff!
but the old man and Kakyoin insisted that I stay with you.
So here I am.
Jotaro...
Good grief.
The World
Ah, the automobile...
Its power and speed are impressive.
In my day, we had only horse-drawn carriages.
Hey! What do you think you're touching?
This car belongs to Senator Phillips!
Do you wanna puke from your eyes?!
My, my... Young folks are so hot-blooded these days.
Ow!
Shut up and get in the front seat. You're going to drive.
Wh-Who the hell are you?!
No, of course he won't!
I graduated high school and college at the top of my class!
I was captain of my college wrestling team!
Even after I graduated, I was respected and revered.
I have a villa on a thousand acres in Hawaii!
I married a beautiful model who's 25 years younger than me!
I pay 50 times more in taxes than ordinary people!
I've defeated every enemy that I've faced.
I'll eventually become president. I am Senator Phillips!
Listen up, young buck!
You hear me? Life in prison—
I'll say it once more.
Drive.
Wh-Who the hell is he? He's going to kill me!
If I don't escape, he'll kill me!
If I don't escape, he kill me!
Help... me?
Wh-What?!
Wh-What?!
Why am I inside?
Floor it until you catch up to that truck.
If you fail to catch up to it, I'll kill you.
Y-Yes, sir.
Why inside?! Why?!
There's nothing a senator can't do!
The black atmosphere that emanates from him is still close...
It's coming after us.
Can DIO tell exactly where you are, Mr. Joestar?
No. His body is that of my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar.
but we can only tell that the other is close, not where he is.
I couldn't tell exactly where the mansion was, either, even though we were nearby.
All he can sense is that a Joestar is nearby.
He can't tell the difference between Jotaro and myself.
He shouldn't be able to realize that Jotaro and I have split up.
That's strange...
In movies, the engine always starts right up.
W-We're stuck in traffic.
Rush hour traffic in the evening is bumper to bumper.
Go.
You say that, but I can't move forward.
The sidewalk is wide enough. Go.
The sidewalk?!
That makes no difference. Go.
Y-Yes, sir!
Floor it.
Yes, sir!
It started. Hurry up and get on, Polnareff.
R-Right...
I've gone to such lengths for you!
You'll spare my life... You'll spare this senator's life now, won't you?!
No.
I see! This is a dream!
It's a dream! A dream! Hooray!
There he is. Get closer to them. Closer.
If I'm not close, I cannot use The World.
He's getting closer. It's that car! DIO's in there!
Kakyoin!
Kakyoin's...
Take this, DIO! Emerald Splash!
Wh-What is he?!
How about this?!
Even when I concentrated the Splash, he dodged. D-Damn it!
When did he release his Stand?
Impossible! How could I not notice?!
He was a bit too far away.
Wh-What's happening?!
Would it benefit me in any way if I told you?
Keep your eyes forward and drive.
Careful, Kakyoin! You got too close to him!
I-I apologize. I-I couldn't help it.
"Relax. Relax, Kakyoin..."
Damn it! Never again! I will never lose again!
Kakyoin, are you all right? Did you see The World?
Yes... I attacked from around ten meters away.
If I had gotten any closer, I would have been done for.
It's obvious that his Stand
But I've managed to figure out two things.
First, it can't attack over distance like Hierophant Green and Hermit Purple.
It's a close-range power type, like Star Platinum.
Its range is about ten meters.
Second, it attacked with its fist.
We need to investigate carefully.
There's no such thing as being too cautious when it comes to him.
That's strange. His car stopped.
Watch out! Something's flying at us!
Mr. Joestar!
What are you doing, Kakyoin?
I've got it.

What are you doing, Kakyoin?
I've got it.
I've figured out a way to reveal what DIO's Stand truly is.
What?!
Rumble
Whenever Noriaki Kakyoin sees his Hierophant Green, this is what he remembers.
Your little Noriaki doesn't try at all to make friends.
It's not that the other kids don't like him.
As his teacher, I'm very concerned.
I'm his mother, yet I still don't know why he's like that.
Ever since I was a child, I thought
that living in a city means meeting a lot of people.
My classmates' address books are filled with their friends' names.
There must be about fifty friends in each.
My mother has my father, and my father has my mother.
But I'm different.
I'm sure rock stars and people on TV have tens of thousands of friends.
But I'm different.
I probably won't ever have someone who sees me for who I am.
Because I don't have a single friend who can see
It's impossible for
I felt that way all the time.
I wonder why I get goosebumps
Perhaps because they were

they became friends I could truly connect with.
Noriaki Kakyoin looks at Hierophant Green and thinks:
I'll make him invisible to everyone, just like he used to be.

Episode 46 DIO's World, Part 2
Hey, Jotaro!
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
That car's crushed to pieces.
Up there.
The old man and DIO are on the rooftops.
Only Kakyoin and Joseph are before me.
I see.
They split up so they could attack from both sides.
So Jotaro and Polnareff must intend to attack me from behind.
How useless.
This is...
Kakyoin's Hierophant!
Hierophant's barrier!
This is...
That's right!
Now I can sense both your movements and The World's!
Take this, DIO! 20-meter radius Emerald Splash!
You fool. You shall soon know
that The World's true power is, indeed, the power to reign over this world!
Bring out your Stand, DIO!
The World!
Doom
What?! Kakyoin!
He was suddenly blown away!
Impossible!
Kakyoin!
Wh-What... just happened?
Did he beat me?
It's no use. I think my injuries are fatal.
I can't speak... I can't even lift a finger.
It's 5:15...
I wonder what my parents are doing.
I'm sorry for making you worry so much.
Noriaki Kakyoin's final thoughts
were not of his parents in Japan.
I can sense every movement of those who touch Hierophant Green's barrier.
But DIO ripped apart the entire barrier at once.
Why wasn't it done strand by strand?
The entire barrier, over a 20-meter radius, was ripped apart all at once?
How?
Without even the slightest delay...
How... all at once...?
How?
Kakyoin!
I-I can't let this continue! Hermit...
Joseph... You're next.
Don't you think taking the blood of a Joestar
DIO!
How could he hit them all with no time passing between them?
Time passing...
Time...
Time...
The time!
I... I understand now.
I-I have to tell them about this!
This terrifying truth... Somehow...
I have to tell Mr. Joestar...
At this rate, everyone will
be defeated.
How dare you do that to Kakyoin?!
I'll take that body back, for my Grandma Erina!
Erina? Ah, that country girl.
How foolish.
I shall drink your blood and kill you.
Joseph Joestar!
Die!
M-My final Emerald... Splash...
What?
I suppose he wanted to use up
Impossible!
So why in that direction?
What does it mean?
Is he trying to tell me something?
It's a... message.
It's the best I can do...
Mr. Joestar...
Kakyoin...
Noriaki Kakyoin
Noriaki Kakyoin has died.
Noriaki Kakyoin — has died —
Hermit Purple!
And take this!
You old fool! Your Stand is the weakest of all!
I won't let you get away!
Kakyoin, why did you shoot the clock tower?
What was shooting the clock tower supposed to tell me?
It must mean something important!
I-It's Mr. Joestar!
Where's Kakyoin?!
Could it be, Kakyoin...
Were you able to solve the mystery
He destroyed the clock with Emerald Splash.
He destroyed the clock's hands...
He... stopped the clock?
I-Impossible! Could it truly be...
The true power of DIO's The World
is the power to stop time!
Take this, DIO! 20-meter radius Emerald Splash!
The World!
Doom
This is The World.
But since time has stopped for you, you can neither see nor feel him.
Die, Kakyoin!
You don't even realize that you've been killed.
There's no way for you to even know what happened.
I understand, Kakyoin!
You died to send me that message... and I've gotten it!
Hermit Purple
Joseph Joestar
It stops time?
It's a Stand that can stop time and keep moving?
That's too dangerous! Way too dangerous!
Calm down... Calm down and think!
I don't know the meaning of the word "panic"!
I need to think of something...
Some way to break through and defeat him!
H-He disappeared!
Wh-What's wrong?
Weren't you going to drink my blood?
You've suffused your body with Hamon
You're quite the schemer, you cunning old geezer.
The same goes for you.
You realized I was using Hamon and made sure not to touch me.
But I've figured something out about your Stand.
About three to four seconds, I'd say.
and you wouldn't have had to chase us down.
So you understand how The World works? Hah!
I'll spare you a bit of praise for that.
It was Kakyoin who figured it out.
And what of it?
What can your Hamon possibly do now?
Hermit Purple and Hamon!
Enough!
Hey, look.
That old guy fell outta the sky!
Santa! I bet he's Santa!
What were you doing on the roof?
Old man...
J-Jotaro!
Stay back!
Don't come near me!
Jotaro... What perfect timing.
But he's not quite in range.
I'll deal with Joseph first.
Jotaro! The secret of his Stand, The World, is time!
It's a Stand that stops ti―
The World!
At first, I could only stop time for a mere blink of an eye.
I soon could stop it for two seconds, then three.
I can now stop time for five seconds.
but I have five seconds in which to act.
Eventually I'll get to a minute... Then ten minutes, then an hour...
Then as long as I want!
knowing that I will be able to stop time for longer and longer...
Oh, that's right, Joseph.
You were using Hamon to protect your body.
but it's powerless before The World.
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless!
Halt
The grandson of Jonathan, Joseph...
You are now dead!
One more second...
Zero.
The World
Old man!
S-Stay back! R-Run... J-Jotaro...
D-Don't go near him.
K-Keep your...
d-distance...
Stay away... Stay away from him...
Y-You're no... match...
I've already taken care of Kakyoin, too.
Polnareff must be hiding somewhere...
Hah. But it doesn't matter.
You're next, Jotaro!
You bastard.
DIO!
Oh? You're approaching me?
Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?
like an exam student scrambling to finish
the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?
I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.
Oh ho! Then come as close as you like.
Too slow, too slow! The World is the ultimate Stand.
Even without his power to stop time, his speed and power
So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.
Not much range, but immense power and precise movements.
I wanted to try a little test to find out
Though it appears a test was hardly necessary.
Well, I guess you ripped my 20,000 yen pants, though.
Why are you Joestars so stubborn about admitting defeat?
Shall we compare the speed of our attack rushes?
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
With this, the Joestar bloodline will finally end.
My archenemies, who dared to make an appearance in my destiny...
Farewell!
Wha—
What?
He just moved!
He... Impossible!
His finger just moved!
I-It can't be.
It can't be!
They're... the same?
So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.
The World and Star Platinum are the same type of Stand?!
Can he see me?
Time's up.
Bam
Could you see me?
I asked if you could see me, Jotaro!
Who knows?
Very well! It doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter if you can see me during stopped time or not!
let me see you moving!
Yes, it was six months ago when I first stopped time.
I had one of my servants fire a shotgun at me.
At first, I thought it was an illusion.
Trained boxers and those who are in accidents
I thought it was something like that.
But The World was able to step
And...
It could grab the pellets!
It's not an illusion!
Lord DIO!
You will surely be able to control time!
You must believe with more conviction that you can move within stopped time!
It must be like breathing.
Like being able to snap an HB pencil in half with your fingers!
You must believe it's a perfectly natural thing for you to do.
What's most important is to recognize it as such.
You must believe that it's natural for you to do it!
You are the emperor of this world!
Clang
And then one day, I felt the wheels of time
truly enmesh themselves with The World.
It was like a beam of light piercing the darkness.
It truly was a magnificent feeling.
I, DIO, had truly surpassed all forms of life and all Stands!
And now, I can stop time for five seconds, and longer and longer intervals each time!
Jotaro! I shall see just how powerful you truly are!
The World! Stop time!
You had placed that magnet on me.
When we were testing each other's strength earlier?
It looks like a magnet taken from a wallet or pocket planner.
You completely fooled me.
But!
You only added a few more seconds to your life!
This time, you will...
Die, Jotaro!
Zwoosh
What?!
H-He... really can move!
Only for a moment, but he can move!
The magnet wasn't to trick me into thinking he could move...
But to trick me into thinking he couldn't, and lure me closer!
You must believe it's only natural that you can stop time!
Of all things, this descendant of the Joestars
has invaded my world of stopped time...
I could move for a moment... Just a moment.
But...
Good grief.
You. Woman.
Fetch my leg from over there.
Hurry up and fetch it!
Behave like a flight attendant, bringing a drink
You've already recovered your energy.
Because that hole I put in your gut is closed up now.
Your eyes followed me in the world of stopped time...
So you truly can see my movements, Jotaro.
Seems so.
Kakyoin did quite well for you.
and so, you were able to invade my world.
Which makes me think...
Just how long can you move within my world of stopped time?
Two seconds? Three?
Well? How about it?
This isn't good.
but right now, a moment is the best I can do.
I believe that you can only move for a moment now.
it would not be wise to underestimate you by getting close.
Even when I still have an overwhelming advantage.
Therefore, Jotaro, I've decided how to kill you
such that it doesn't matter how long you can move!
You've gone pale.
Bastard!
He's dangerous.
You cannot escape!
The World!
Five more seconds!
I wonder if even your Star Platinum
Four more seconds!
Being able to see this must be all the more terrifying, Jotaro!
Three more seconds...
Just two more seconds... Is that all you can do?
This proves that you really can move only for a moment.
One more second...
Zero.
It's over.
To be frank, I'm relieved that
I never thought you would be able to enter my stopped time.
but because everyone has one, the streets become too crowded.
Only I, DIO, should have power over stopped time.
Good grief.
Throwing all those knives...
Now my valuable uniform is full of holes.
I stuffed my clothes with magazines just in case he tried throwing anything...
But I didn't think he'd throw that many knives at me.
Playing dead and waiting for a chance to strike is the
I need to figure out how to knock off his head...
I'd better play it safe.
The Joestar bloodline has proven itself rather lucky.
He might be trying to trick me by playing dead.
I must end him beyond a shadow of a doubt!
By...
chopping his head off with this!
Jotaro!
Die, DIO!
The World
Die!
Polnareff!
The World! Time has stopped...
So it's you, Polnareff?
And time will move once more.
Too bad, Polnareff.
you could have torn my brain apart with your rapier.
B-Bastard! This is impossible...
You cannot assassinate DIO.
Joestar's Egyptian tour group
Damn it. Polnareff's going to get killed.
It would be easy for me to keep Polnareff's head on his shoulders.
But DIO won't enter Star Platinum's attack range.
It'll end up like it did last time.
I have to make sure he doesn't realize I'm alive.
Talk about irony.
but now I have to try my hardest to stay completely still.
Farewell, Polnareff!
Jotaro, you...
You're alive... or you're coming around.
Dont move! We're the police!
We have guns pointed at you!
Put your hands up slowly.
All right. Perfect timing.
There's something I'd like you to shoot with that gun.
Shoot the man lying on the ground over there.
You can shoot his leg, his torso... Whatever you like.
Come on. Be sure not to miss.
Perhaps I was just imagining that sound I thought
What a sick thing to do...
But now DIO's attention is on me, not Polnareff.
Right now, he's suspicious as all hell.
He'll try to make absolutely sure that I'm dead.
The sound of his breathing...
I don't hear it. He's not breathing.
Then what about his heartbeat?
This is damn tough...
It won't even be funny...
If I die because I used my Stand to stop my own heart...
His heart isn't beating. He is definitely dead.
I thought he was still alive, but it was just my imagination.
Just in case, I'll lop off his head so that I can truly rest at ease.
All right, Jotaro?
What?!
Rumble
Stop time!
I went through hell there...
I'm still going to blow your head off, DIO.
Wh-What? It can't be...
Finally...
Finally, I was able to bash his head in.
But that bastard DIO is a monster
Menacing
I can't believe he's dead yet.
It's too soon to relax.
I'll kill you...
Wh-What is this? Impossible! M-My legs...
I can't move my legs.
I can't stand!
I have a headache... a-and nausea...
How could this happen? Me, DIO, feeling sick?
My head's been destroyed, so I can't get up?!
Damn it! I have to do something!
I covered you with gasoline so I can track your smell.
I feel bad, kicking a guy when he's down, but...
Nah. I don't feel bad about this at all.
My friends and a lot of innocent bystanders
The World!
If I can...
If I can get to that place...
Time... Time will move once more.
He put his ear to the ground to listen for cars coming near.
I can't let him get away!
Screech
That place... That place!
If I can just get there...
This place is taken. You can't escape.
Give up, DIO.
The World! Sto—
You fell for it, Jotaro!
This is my escape route!
You have lost in the battle of wits against me, DIO!
Doesn't this street look familiar?
This street... I-It can't be...
That's right.
DIO, you bastard!

As I thought...
Joseph's blood suits me well.
my strength is recovering faster than ever before!
It suits me...
It truly suits me!
This body belonged to Jonathan Joestar one hundred years ago.
The blood that I just drank was from his grandson, Joseph!
And the one who allowed me to make it this far
was you, Jotaro.
But in the end, it appears that the Joestars are fated to be my tools.
O-Old man...
O-Old man.
No matter...
you must never get enraged and lose your cool, Jotaro.
Don't worry about me anymore.
This happened because it had to happen.
Is this... the old man's soul?
Kakyoin solved the mystery of DIO's Stand.
I relayed his message to you.
If we had all fought DIO at once, we would have all perished instantly.
You've become able to move a bit within stopped time.
You have two or three seconds now...
Use that time wisely.
No matter what DIO does now, you mustn't get angry.
Jotaro...
This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?
So much happened.
I swear...
Was I seeing things?
Hey!
Where are you looking, Jotaro?
Bam
B-Bastard...
Now he's just an empty shell!
The old man told me not to get angry, no matter what.
But that's not possible.
No one could stay calm after seeing that!
This is the final round!
The World!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Episode 48 Long Journey Farewell, My Friends
The World! Stop time!
Wryyyyyyyyyy!
One second has passed! Two seconds have passed...
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.
Three seconds have passed! Four seconds...
Five seconds have passed.
Six seconds have passed.
Seven seconds have passed!
I still feel the power!
I can still keep it up!
By the way, Jotaro.
You probably gambled on the two seconds
but you've miscalculated.
What a truly magnificent feeling!
I feel so good, I could break out into song!
Eight seconds have passed!
but I didn't feel as absolutely wonderful then as I do now!
Joestar blood suits me so very well!
This is the greatest high!
O-Old man... You were right.
But this isn't the end of it.
I still have plenty more rage to hurl at him!
Nine seconds have passed!
But it appears that stopping time for nine seconds is my current limit.
Y-You bastard...
Now to unleash all of my Stand's power!
Jotaro! You said something about being pissed off...
But your fury can achieve no more than that!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless!
And now, without pause, my final attack!
The last and final time I will stop time!
Within my nine seconds of stopped time, I shall end this!
The World!
One second has passed.
Two seconds have passed.
Three seconds have passed.
For some reason, DIO disappeared while time was stopped.
Four seconds have passed.
However, Jotaro has abandoned thought.
all he needs to do is drive Star Platinum's fists into him in those two seconds!
Five seconds have passed.
Six seconds have passed.
Bring it on, DIO!
Seven seconds have passed.
Road roller!
Kaboom
It's too late! You cannot escape!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Eight seconds have passed!
I'll smash you flat!
Nine seconds have passed.
I did it.
It is over.
Immortality! Eternal life!
And Stand power!
This proves that no one can surpass DIO!
Puny humans! I shall rule you all!
Bow before my knowledge and might!
Ten seconds have passed!
Now my ability to stop time has reached ten seconds!
Now, then...
If there's any blood left to take!
Wh-What?
N-No... I'm not slowing down...
I-I cannot move. I-Impossible!
M-My b-body won't move at all!
DIO!
It's been eleven seconds.
What?!
I stopped time at the nine second mark.
Good grief.
Now...
J-Jotaro!
The World
I-Impossible! You stopped time?
Right at the end of my nine seconds of movement...
How does it feel, DIO?
is like when a guy who can hold his breath underwater for a minute
finally comes up for air at the very last second...
When suddenly, he feels someone grab him, and he's dragged
Does that sound right?
But for you, I feel no pity at all.
Crack
Time has begun to move again.
I don't feel even the slightest bit of compassion for you.
I haven't even an ounce of pity for you.
However, just finishing you off by beating you to death now
How many seconds will it take for your legs to recover?
Three seconds? Four?
The moment you've healed, I'll throw Star Platinum at you.
So bring it on!
If I were a gunslinger in a Western, I'd say...
"Draw. Let's see who's the fastest gun in the West."
H-He's...
But... But, Jotaro...
You may have come this far, but you are still only human.
You think like a human, who has so little time to live.
That kind of reasoning is about as compelling as rat shit
I, DIO, have no such thoughts.
Within my mind is but one simple thought.
To be victorious and rule! That is all.
That is all I need to feel satisfaction!
How I do it...
...does not matter!
How do you like being blinded by blood?!
I've won! Die!
Wha...
What?!
I-Impossible... I-I'm DIO...
I am DIO!
Now if I just wait until dawn, you'll turn into dust.
There's only one reason why you lost, DIO.
There's just one simple answer.
You really pissed me off.

Jotaro Kujo
This is the Speed Wagon Foundation Car Two.
We are currently traveling north on Al-Nil Street.
We have retrieved DIO's body.
I repeat. We have retrieved DIO's body.
DIO's body will stay alive until it is exposed to sunlight.
Make sure you don't let down your guard.
Roger.
Noriaki Kakyoin is dead. We are transporting his body via helicopter.
Jean Pierre Polnareff is unconscious.
Roger.
By the way, I've got a question for you, Car Two...
Why did you put DIO and Joseph Joestar's bodies in the same car?
Because it's not over yet.
Huh?
And I need to get it back.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Is it possible to transfuse blood from one corpse to another?
A-Are you suggesting we put DIO's blood into Mr. Joestar's withered corpse?
Are you trying to bring Mr. Joestar back to life?
DIO sucked out his blood just minutes ago.
Don't you think we can still make it in time?
So he says. Did you hear that? Over.
R-Roger...
I-It's impossible! He doesn't have a pulse...
Impossible?
We did a lot of impossible things on this journey.
I'm tired of hearing that things are "impossible" or "useless."
You said we have to get his heart moving, right?
Good timing.
I hear a pulse!
His heart's moving!
Hurry! Extract the blood from DIO's body and perform the transfusion!
This just might work!
L-Look!
His shriveled skin is already regaining color!
His flesh is softening and stretching!
Brainwaves! We're detecting brainwaves!
I can't believe it! His heartbeat is regular!
His eyes! He opened his eyes!
We did it! He's come back to life!
Old man?
You fool, Jotaro!
Y-You bastard! It can't be...
Thanks to you, I live again!
You!
W-Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding! Kidding! I'm just kidding!
It's just a joke! A joke!
Sorry! I was just messing with you a little.
It's definitely me!
I'm Joseph Joestar. I was born September 27th, 1920.
My wife's name is Suzie Q. I like to collect comic books!
Who's the female lead in the 1981 film, ?
Bo Derek.
Who sang the parody of "Beat It," named "Eat It"?
Al Yankovic.
This is Car Two. It's amazing!
Mr. Joestar has come back from the dead!
Now, it's over.
So many people lent something to DIO.
Many people, for the last hundred years.
They lent him everything.
And too many of those things will never be returned.
Yeah. The things we can't get back are too numerous, and too great.
What we've lost is as vast as the planet Earth itself.
But it's all because of them...
It's because of them that we still live.
Kakyoin.
Iggy.
Avdol.
It's over.
Are you really going back to France, Polnareff?
You don't have any more family there, do you?
Mr. Joestar, even though my family is gone, France is my homeland.
I have many memories in my hometown.
No matter where I go, I'll always return there.
But if you ever need me, give me a call.
Wherever in the world you are, I'll come running.
It'll be lonely without you.
but it was a lot of fun.
Yeah.
Well, see ya, you shit-stained geezer! I hope you live forever!
And you, his stingy grandson! Don't you dare forget me!
Let us meet again!
I couldn't forget a guy like you if I tried.
Take care.
So long.
Yeah.
So long.
Holly...
Why are you sitting up all of a sudden?
I... Suddenly, I feel so much better!
And I just felt it in my heart...
What?
They're both coming home, Mama!
Holly!
Papa and Jotaro!
They're coming home!
End
and your host, once again, is me, your neighbor, Kai Harada.
What a refreshing morning.
Here's our first song of the morning.
Oh, there we go.
We usually get good reception when we pass that tower.
Is this your first time in Morioh, sir?
Yeah.
What kind of place is it?
Morioh? Hmm...
Oh! The beef tongue cooked in miso is good.
Anything strange about it? Any incidents?
No idea.
Oh, where was I supposed to drop you off again?
In front of the station is fine.
Understood.
Good grief...
I just hope nothing annoying happens.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
In April of 1999, on my very first day of high school, I met two bizarre men.
 Jotaro Kujo! Meets Josuke Higashikata
I finally start high school today... I wonder what the people will be like.
My name's Koichi Hirose.
I was so nervous on my first walk to my new school that I...
Bam
and the things in my bag flew out...
Sorry I wasn't watching where I was going.
H-He's huge! He's over 190 centimeters!
I have a question.
Higashikata? No...
Then how about this address?
Jotaro Kujo
Jotaro Kujo...
If you take the #3 bus, it'll get you to Johzenji.
If you wait a little while, it'll get here soon.
Thanks.
The first guy was this man, Jotaro Kujo.
I found this out later, but he's 28, and he's a marine explorer.
He's famous in the scientific world for his ecological research.
He seems really wild, but intelligent... or cool, I guess.
Hey! Are you a new kid?
You better introduce yourself.
Y-Yes, sir! My name is Koichi Hirose, and I'm a new student.
Good morning, Senpai!
All right. Well said.
S-So scary...
Oh, it's okay. They're getting on a different bus.
The hell are you doing, you bastard?!
Who do you think you are?
What am I doing? Well...
The turtle that lives in this pond woke up from hibernation, so I was watching it.
I don't handle turtles really well. I'm scared to even touch them.
So I was thinking it's about time I got over my fear...
That's not what I asked!
Stand up, dumbass!
You're pretty tall for a first-year.
But before you have the nerve to dress like that...
You dumb shit! Who said you could wear that?
You need to talk to us first!
W-Wait... I'm not a fan of reptiles.
They scare me...
Slap
What the hell are you smiling at?
I'm sorry. I had no idea, Senpai.
There are a lot of guys
You wanna end up
Th-They're awful...
I'll let you off the hook this time.
Take off that jacket and the pants, and leave them here.
With your cash!
Yes, sir! I'm very sorry!
That just means if you don't want them after you, don't dress like that.
What pisses me off more is that
Hey, wimp. Why don't you tell me your name?
Yes, sir.
Josuke Higashikata, from Class 1-B.
What? Josuke Higashikata?
Student ID Name: Josuke Higashikata
"Jo" and "Jo," eh?
Josuke, we're gonna call you "Jojo" from now on!
Okay... Thank you very much.
Hurry up and take off that uniform.
The damn bus is here.
If you don't hurry it up, I'm gonna shave off that Astro Boy hair, too.
Well, what are you waiting for? Hurry it up!
Hey, Senpai...
What did you just say about my hair?
What? A Stand?!
My nose... My nose!
I won't let anyone get away with making fun of my hair, no matter who it is!
Did you say my hair looked like Sazae-san?
Huh?! No one said that...
I heard you, damn it!
What the heck? That punk just went flying.
Some kind of Stand just appeared from behind him.
Huh? That turtle's wounds are...
What the heck?
Hey, he's all better!
But does it look like it healed all weird?
His face looks kinda different.
Huh?
No way! What does it look like? Hey!
What are you gonna do about that, huh?!
Wait! My nose! What's it look like? Huh?
Good grief. So he's...
Gah! That scared me!
Oh, it's just the turtle again.
I was right. That turtle's all better.
Josuke Higashikata...
Born in 1983.
You've lived here ever since you were born.
and for the next 50 days, no one knew if you'd survive or not.
Your father's name is...
Good grief. This is such a rotten role to play.
Your father's name is Joseph Joestar.
He's currently 78.
I've heard of him before.
I found out that he had a son in Japan, which would be you.
He didn't even know about it himself.
That old piece of shit...
yet I just found his son who was born when he was 62 years old
Whoops. I guess I shouldn't have said that.
My name's Jotaro Kujo.
How bizarre.
Nephew? Oh, uh... Nice to meet you.
Let's talk while we walk.
And so, eventually, you're gonna get a third of the old man's inheritance.
I came here to tell you that.
It's in chaos?
Yeah... My grandma, Suzie Q, is the angriest she's ever been
I-I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry I've caused such a fuss!
Hey, now. Hold up.
Why are you suddenly apologizing?
Well, I mean, causing trouble in a family is no good.
My mother has told me that she was in love when she gave birth to me.
I accept that, too.
That's all.
What's with this kid?
and instead, he's actually apologizing?
Hey, it's Josuke!
Oh, it is!
Josuke!
How are you?
Talk about a coincidence!
Let's go to school together.
Your hair looks as cool as ever.
You're looking sharp.
You're so different from the other guys.
Um... I'm actually in the middle of something important right now...
Huh? What the heck?
If you don't hurry, we're going to be late.
You can talk later.
Hey, Josuke.
What's his problem?
Hey, have your stupid talk about hair later.
H-He actually said it.
He talked shit about his hair!
You bastard...
What were you saying about my hair, huh?!
This isn't good.
Don't blame me!
Josuke hates people insulting his hair more than anything else.
It's just like what happened earlier!
Hold it, Josuke.
Shit! Here it comes!
Josuke!
There's blood!
Did you see it, Josuke?
It's the physical manifestation of your psychological energy.
Joseph Joestar has one, too.
Stands can only be seen by other Stand users.
It pisses me off when someone talks bad about my awesome hair.
I can't even help it!
So this is Josuke's Stand!
Th-This power...
You're wide open from your chin down!
Bastard!
What?!
Huh?
When did that happen?
What's going on?
When did y—
Josuke!
No!
Josuke!
Shut up!
Fine...
It seems like they know each other.
Besides, he's scary.
But he's kind of hot...
I don't get it...
I have no idea what's going on!
But something is definitely happening!
It's been a while...
Actually, it's been ten years.
But I was able to stop time for half a second.
but one of us would've been badly injured.
Here, Josuke.
Ah, uh... No. It's okay.
I see.
There's actually another reason I came to see you.
The other reason is this picture.
Something is hiding in this town.
Something very dangerous is approaching.
this is what he got instead.
We're not sure why...
But he's probably a Stand user.
This doesn't concern you, but I wanted to at least show you the picture.
You've been warned.
Koichi-kun...
If you happen to see him, don't go anywhere near him.
Calling the police won't help.
Just run.
Josuke...
You'll get hurt, just like a moment ago.
Oh! The entrance ceremony!
Ack! Look at the time!
Aw, shit...
Hey, I'll listen to everything you've got to say after school.
Hey, Koichi, was it? Let's go!
Huh?
Hurry!
Right!
The other bizarre guy I happened to meet is Josuke Higashikata.
He's unpredictable and can go right from goofy to pissed off.
I guess his family situation is complicated.
And we only just met...
Josuke Higashikata... What a weird guy.
And his Stand...
This hat... It's back together?
So his Stand reforms things into a different shape after they're broken?
If it had been my face or head...
Talk about creepy.
If you overlook his ridiculous personality, anyway.
I just hope this has nothing to do with Josuke.

Hey, girl!
Where are you headed? I'll give you a ride.
Hey, don't be so cold!
C'mon! C'mon!
Ooh, v-very pretty!
You'll go wherever I want?
Hell yeah! I'd go anywhere with you.
Then you can go straight to Hell!
Huh?
Crush
Hey, you okay?
Officer!
G-Go get that crazy bitch!
Nah, I can't do that.
What?!
That's my daughter.
Huh?
I'll let it go this time, but be more careful in the future.
You okay, Old Lady Murakami?
Come on. Grab your bag.
Hey, Tomoko!
Dad.
You headed home?
Yeah.
Let's go home together. I'm done for the day.
How's Josuke?
He'd better not be up to any trouble.
Hmph. Who knows?
I wonder who he took after.
Hey, now...
But...
Deep down, in the bottom of his heart, he's kind.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm planning to.
But I wonder if he'll come home early.
No doubt.
Hey, I want to stop by Kame Yu.
Huh? I just bought you an expensive bag the other day.
I want to look at, like, clothes today.
Watch it, dumbass!
Pay attention to where you're walking, moron.
He's super creepy.
He's not even gonna apologize after running into someone?
Forget him. Come on.
I know. You just wanna go to Kame Yu, right?
Huh?
Anjuro Katagiri, a.k.a. Angelo.
Born in Morioh in 1964.
He was sent to juvie for robbery and rape when he was just 12.
he's become the most awful
and disgusting criminal in Japan's history.
a total of 20 years by the time he'd turned 34.
His last crime was so vile, it'd make even a rat in the bathroom puke.
He was eventually arrested, and the sentence they gave him
was death.
But, somehow, the execution failed to kill him.
Shortly after, Angelo escaped.
He most likely became a Stand user right before his execution.
but he's hiding out in this quiet town...
Koichi, you heading home?
Oh... Yeah.
We're in the same class.
Yeah... Talk about coincidences.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Ah... Hey! J-Josuke!
Huh?
Oh, you want to hear what that Jotaro guy has to say?
It's been bugging me, and it has to do with this town.
You're amazing. I'm gonna pass.
Why?
I don't think getting involved with being some guy's lovechild is a good idea.
Why?
Well, I mean...
Things are just fine as they are right now.
I see...
I wonder what that is.
Maybe an accident or something?
Wanna go after it?
Yeah.
What? Are they shooting a drama?
It's dangerous, so step back. Step back!
Talk about a huge commotion.
A man robbing that convenience store took a female employee hostage inside.
Huh?
Look! There he is!
Don't move! Drop the knife!
Let the girl go!
Shut up! Get back!
Th-That lady has rung me up before!
His eyes are messed up. He'll totally kill her if he loses it.
All of you, get outta the way! I'm getting into the car!
This isn't good, Josuke! Get back! Back!
R-Right.
Hey, you with the stupid hair!
Sorry, let us step back—
I told you to get away from the car!
I have...
a bad feeling about this.
I knew it!
C-Crap! Here it comes!
At a time like this? In this situation?
After Mr. Jotaro warned him!
Who's that?
H-Hey! Stop!
What did you just say?
Wh-Who the hell are you? Get away from me.
You don't care what happens to her?
Get back, you fool!
What are you going to do if he loses it?
I told you guys to stay back, too!
D-Damn it! You're pissing me off!
I've made up my mind! I'm gonna stab this girl!
Oh, really?
Th-There's a hole in his body!
I pissed you off?
That's my line!
Huh? I-I'm fine?!
She's back to normal. It's happening again.
M-My army knife! It's inside my stomach!
H-How?!
You'd better get a surgeon to take that out... in the prison hospital.
S-Seize him!
What's going on?
Josuke!
Hey, Koichi.
Are you okay?! That was...
What the...
What are you doing, opening your mouth?
Who would have thought
I possessed this man and was having a blast with that robbery, and then...
How dare you get in my way?!
He's the guy from the picture!
I'll be watching you from now on.
I'll be watching you all the time.
What'd you say, you bastard?!
Josuke!
You idiot! Get him!
What were you thinking?!
M-Mr. Officer! W-Wait a sec...
What Mr. Jotaro said was true.
Let me go! I didn't do anything!
There's something in this town...
I can feel the presence of something completely unknown.
Something bad is here in Morioh.
Hey, Josuke! Answer the phone!
Josuke! Answer the damn phone!
Yeah, yeah. One sec.
Hello?
It's Jotaro.
Oh, hi.
We didn't have a chance to actually talk yesterday.
We need to talk about the guy hiding in this town.
Oh, I actually wanted to talk to you about that.
Mr. Jotaro, where are you right now?
The Morioh Grand Hotel.
What happened?
Well...
Damn it, this pisses me off.
Where the hell did I put the shovel?
That little brat...
Looks like he's got a cozy little family.
Not to mention he's got himself a hot, young mother...
I'm jealous.
Josuke Higashikata, don't get cocky, now.
I'm going to destroy your livelihood, your soul, and your life.
Josuke Higashikata! Meets Angelo
Episode 2 suke Higashikata! Meets Angelo
Jeez...
Damn it, this pisses me off.
Now, where did I put it?
Anjuro Katagiri, a.k.a. Angelo.
He's become the most awful and disgusting criminal in Japan's history.
He's repeatedly committed murders ever since he was 12.
His last murder...
Milkman! Watch your step over there!
...was lower than dog shit.
he happened to meet three 14-year-olds.
He raped and murdered two of them.
Did you step in it?
Yes, it appears so.
Seriously, it pisses me off.
Letting their dog shit in front of someone else's house...
I'm really thinking of keeping it
Um... I left your milk over there.
I'll be off now.
You...
Yes, I'm just covering this morning.
Huh...
he demanded a ransom.
That's what led to his arrest.
I might just be picky, but the seal on this milk's lid is broken.
Huh?
Is it?
Yeah, right here!
Oh, yeah...
See? It's broken, right?
Yeah. Sorry about that.
I'll be going now.
Thanks.
Good day.
Damn that bitch!
Glob
That woman's pretty watchful.
my Stand, Aqua Necklace, could have possessed them!
Another one? You just keep going, don't you?
they found a truly horrific sight.
The boy was dead, and his privates
had been chopped off and nailed to a pillar near the corpse.
Why the hell didn't you clean up your dog's shit?
On top of that, you just threw your cigarette on the ground, didn't you?
Don't get cocky!
Because those who get cocky...
can just swallow my Stand and die.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Josuke Higashikata! Meets Angelo
So it seemed like that Stand had possessed the robber...
Or rather, it was just in his body. It didn't attack me.
Was Angelo nearby? The guy in the picture.
No, I didn't see him.
Damn it, my hair's not setting right.
Listen up. That Stand's power is weak, but it can be controlled remotely.
It's the type that can somehow enter people.
I'm heading to your house now.
Huh? Right now?
Don't eat or drink anything until I get there.
That includes tap water.
Hold on a second. I haven't told my mom about you yet.
and cries when she thinks about him.
She'll know who you are with one look.
Josuke, where did this picture come from?
This is the milkman from earlier...
Do you know him?
Hey, Josuke. What's wrong?
Crap! I was too late.
I just saw that thing go into my mom's mouth from the coffee!
Hello? Josuke? Hey! Josuke!
Josuke, you want some coffee, too?
Yeah, sure. Could you put in some milk and sugar for me?
Milk and sugar, right?
Do-
Boom
Josuke? Was it milk and sugar?
Yeah.
Hello? Jotaro?
I caught that Stand, but...
What?
What should I do with it?
How in the hell...
Be careful. Angelo should be watching over your house from somewhere.
Don't take your eyes off that Stand.
Angelo, Criminal Condemned to Death, Escapes
There's no doubt that Angelo was able to escape prison and death row
But I still don't know the specifics of that Stand's power.
Dead ball!
And that's the game!
The game ends with a dead ball!
There, there.
You little shit!
Josuke! You need to get going, or you'll be late!
I'll kill them both! That little brat and his hot mom!
Yup!
I need to either get the cap off
or break open this bottle, somehow...
He's...
I'm home. You really feel it when you work the night shift at my age.
Higashikata...
So this is Officer Higashikata's house.
I haven't seen him since I was 12. Talk about memories.
I know everything about you!
Freeze.
Josuke, why aren't you at school?
Are you allowed to take your gun home, Gramps?
Oh, shush! Answer me.
I-I'm going! I'm just waiting for someone.
You fool. This is just a model gun.
You scaredy-cat.
I guess I win the first round in our weekly contest to scare each other.
Yeah, yeah. I lose.
Hm? What's wrong? You're not even trying to argue this time.
Nothing. Mom already left.
Now, our next story.
News Bureau
7 Bodies Found In Park
The number of strange deaths occurring
due to the center of the eye or ear
which have only occurred in Morioh.
I've heard about this.
It definitely reeks of foul play to me.
I can't help but feel like someone really dangerous is hiding in this city.
Gramps...
Morioh's masterpiece, beef tongue in miso.
He's here...
I know you well, Higashikata.
After you finish your night shift, you always enjoy a shot of brandy.
Josuke, grab the bottle and get in the car.
Let's take it somewhere isolated.
Right.
G-Gramps...
Josuke Higashikata, this is all your fault!
It's all your fault for not keeping your eyes on me.
You got too cocky!
It cheers me up
when I see cocky guys step into the depths of despair!
That was close! That power is incredible...
You're still being cocky!
I'll kill you, whatever it takes!
Gramps opened the cap on the bottle.
But there's nothing to worry about.
It's just a minor wound. My Stand can easily...
All fixed.
It can't be...
He should wake up.
My Stand can heal wounds.
I've done it lots of times since I was a kid.
I even fixed my friend's broken bone...
Hey, Gramps! I'm gonna be mad if you're messing around.
Did you really fall asleep because you had the night shift?
You don't need to try to scare me anymore!
Gramps! Gramps!
Josuke...
The wound's been completely...
It can be said that humans live by destroying.
In the midst of all that, your power is kinder than anything else.
No matter the Stand, it can't bring it back.
For 35 years, he protected this city as a police officer.
he had the eyes of a man who was protecting his city.
Angelo has killed many.
There must be several bodies of people from this city
There's no reason for his murders.
It's a hobby to him.
And he'll keep killing, I'm sure.
He's probably going to start by killing you and your mom.
I'll...
I'll protect this city and my mom in his place.
No matter what happens.

The funeral has ended, and his uniform hangs in the closet.
who would say, "What? This is what I like," are neatly folded and lined up.
But eventually, they will probably be disposed of.
Because, despite his daughter
no one will ever wear them again.
Josuke probably doesn't want to see anyone right now.
so don't consume anything else.
How's your mom?
I had her go to a relative's house after the funeral.
Good idea. She can come back after we kick Angelo's ass.
I'm not pissed off or anything.
I'm calm. Completely calm.
Calm, huh?
By the way, that scar on your lip...
That's from when I punched you.
Can't your Stand heal your wounds?
My Stand can't heal my own wounds.
What if his Stand enters your body and starts tearing things up from the inside?
I'd probably die.
If it invades me, I lose.
You're gonna try to trap my Stand in a bottle again?
That ain't happening again, Josuke. I know your powers very well now.
Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow...
I'll wait patiently for my chance.
— 3 Days Later —
He's come this close to see what's going on...
But these past three days, he hasn't made a single move.
What's he waiting for?
It's raining...
Rain?
What the hell?
Well, whatever. I've been waiting for this moment.
This house is now mine!
Josuke!
He was just here all of a sudden, boiling the water.
He's twisted the faucet, too.
Angelo's Stand has entered the house.
He wasn't waiting for you to drink the water.
He was waiting for it to rain!
His Stand can move in the rain... No.
It can move freely in liquids.
Josuke! Stay away from that kettle!
The steam is him!
This is just great.
Stay away from the steam. If you inhale that, you're in trouble.
Get out of the kitchen.
About that... It seems like it won't even do any good to get out of here.
Angelo has already made several holes in the roof.
So it's dangerous to go upstairs, obviously, or outside.
This is just great...
I never would have thought a power
He's pretty smart.
What's so funny? We're trapped.
Hey!
I mean, Jotaro...
The guy who killed my Gramps is this close.
This is just great!
Now, then. Let's finish this.
Now, Josuke...
How would you
slip out of this situation?
Slip out?
I wouldn't quite word it like that.
I would break out!
Hurry, this way!
The wall's going to go back to normal.
Good grief.
Well, we've blocked the steam...
The humidifier!
Josuke!
I've won! Just as I thought, Josuke!
I knew you'd break through the wall and come into this room!
Shit!
I can't help but feel lucky from the bottom of my heart and laugh.
It just bubbles out!
Josuke!
What Angelo just said is wrong, Jotaro.
Josuke?
Even when things end up exactly as I expect, I don't feel like laughing...
Not when it comes to Angelo.
That's...
Got it. Sorry, it's a bit gross.
I shredded up a rubber glove and swallowed it beforehand.
I see. It appears the user's body is over there.
Sh-Shit!
So you're...
...Angelo.
Damn it!
Y-You guys aren't going to kill me, are you?!
Sure, I'm an escaped death row inmate.
But just because I was found guilty by Japanese law
doesn't mean you guys have the right to judge me!
Josuke! I killed your grandpa, but you have no right to kill me!
If you kill me, you'll end up a cursed soul, just like me!
Don't go telling people what they can and can't do.
M-M-My right hand! My hand!
No one's going to execute you.
Not me, and not Jotaro, either.
Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.
Wh-What do you plan to do with me, you bastards?!
Repent for eternity, Angelo!
You're gonna live forever in the city my Gramps protected.
The Angelo Stone.
 Directions One minute's walk from Morioh Johzenji Street Bus Stop #3
and a place where lovers meet.
despite its creepy appearance.
He really is pretty crazy.
Good grief...

Yeah. The issue with Angelo's been resolved.
But I won't be coming back for a while.
That other photo we've been investigating...
Send it over, too.
Yeah, the one that the Speedwagon Foundation found in Egypt ten years ago.
I think I might finally know what it means.
Please.
Yeah, thanks to him.
Josuke! I killed your grandpa, but you have no right to kill me!
If you kill me, you'll end up a cursed soul, just like me!
Don't go telling people what they can and can't do.
M-M-My right hand! My hand!
No one's going to execute you.
Not me, and not Jotaro, either.
and you're not going back to jail.
Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.
Wh-What do you plan to do with me, you bastards?!
Repent for eternity, Angelo!
Damn it...
Don't you dare get cocky!
What? "He"?
What?
Are you saying someone can willingly give another a Stand?
Are you scared?
Huh? How is that supposed to scare us?
No... Angelo's not a Stand user by birth.
It was a mystery how he obtained his Stand powers.
But if there is actually a person who can give others Stands...
Terrifying, isn't it?
Want me to tell you?
on a night about a month before my execution.
I couldn't sleep that night...
It was a completely silent night.
But then...
but he was there.
H-Hey! How long have you been there?!
Wha...
It was a very old bow and arrow.
Wh-What are you doing?
I was so scared, I could almost feel my balls shriveling up.
But before I even had a chance to scream...
You're alive. Congratulations.
That means you've got the aptitude. If you didn't, you'd be dead.
You've just obtained a talent.
No... It's more accurate to say it was pulled from your mind.
The worse the villain, the more they have...
This talent that the man named DIO called a "Stand."
DIO?
Did you say DIO?
Jotaro? Is something...
What?!
You fools!
It looks like you were so busy
Angelo, you bastard!
Josuke! Hurry up and get me out of this rock!
It would appear that...
I didn't have enough rage in my heart for you.
What are you doing? Stop messing with your stupid hair!
I'm gonna kill this brat! Let me out right now!
What did you say...
Don't be rash, Josuke!
...about my hair?
He lives in this town, too!
What? Josuke, wait!
Ker-Blam
Yeah... I just didn't have enough rage earlier.
I needed to do a great job of burying that asshole into the rock, like this.
Good grief.
I wanted to get a bit more out of him.
Huh? You actually believe the crap he was saying?
It wasn't crap. He said DIO's name.
Who is that, anyway?
He's a man that the Joestar family has been fighting for over a hundred years.
My friends and I fought DIO and defeated him.
But there was one thing that I didn't understand.
Back in 1987, why did the man called DIO suddenly acquire a Stand?
Could the same person have made him a Stand user?
Yeah... The guy in the school uniform might be our new enemy.
Or perhaps it's the bow and arrow he had.
If that's somewhere in this city...
Then it's hard to believe that Angelo's the only danger here.
Good grief...
Morioh Town Report
Morioh Town Report
It's just like Jotaro said.
There's no doubt that the worst thing imaginable is hiding in this city.
An extremely terrible danger is coming to this city...
Since the beginning of this year, 1999, 81 people have disappeared in Morioh.
Abductions & Kidnapping Cases
Of that number, 45 of them were young boys and girls.
Have You Seen This Person?
That number is extreme.
Not to mention...
Josuke's grandfather...
Koichi, you're even studying after school?
Oh, right.
Thank goodness. Josuke seems to be feeling better.
Yo, Angelo.
Uh... Huh? Hey, was this rock always here?
Yeah, but it didn't look like this at first.
At first?
Well, whatever. Yo, Angelo...
By the way, what happened to Jotaro?
Oh, he said he had something he wanted to look into.
He's staying at the Grand Hotel.
Does it have to do with this city?
I'm sure it does.
I see.
The danger this city faces...
Huh? Josuke?
No one's lived in this house for about three or four years, right?
Yeah. It's so run-down that there's no way it'd sell.
It should be torn down and rebuilt.
No, someone's living here. Maybe someone moved in?
There was someone in the window just now.
Huh? Nah, that can't be. My house is over there, right?
I'd know right away if someone moved in.
Besides, realtors are always checking
Now that you mention it, that's true.
How strange. I wonder if I actually saw a ghost...
H-Hey, don't say stuff like that.
Stop gawking at my house, little brat.
Billion
Say something!
Koichi!
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?
What? That's my line.
You two are in front of my house...
Morioh Landmark 1 How to get there: A minute's walk from Morioh Johzenji Street Bus Stop #3. The Angelo Stone is known as a landmark, and a place where lovers meet. It's admired by the people of the city, despite its creepy appearance.
Give it a rest.
Who is it?!
Could you come back another time?
Y-You're...
Jo...
Joseph!
You finally came back, Joseph!
I was waiting for you this whole time!
I've been so sad and lonely since my dad died.
I can't believe you showed up at a time like this, Joseph!
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you!
I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not Joseph Joestar.
Huh?
Take a good look. No wrinkles.
Oh... Now that you mention it...
You're pretty young!
Good grief...
I'm Joseph's grandson. My name's Jotaro Kujo.
O-Oh, really?
Ask Josuke for the rest of the details.
I hate annoying conversations.
I'm here to see Josuke. Is he here?
I'm asking you where Josuke is.
Huh? Oh! Josuke hasn't come home from school... yet.
I see... Then I'll be back tonight.
Huh?
You're leaving already?
Oh, yeah...
About your father...
Huh?
It's a shame.
But he's old now.
I can't let him come here.
I'm here in his place.
I just can't feel at ease.
The bow and arrow that Angelo was talking about...
In documents the Speedwagon Foundation obtained regarding the witch, Enyaba...
She's holding the bow and arrow.
They give ordinary people the power of a Stand.
Damn, that's unbelievable...
No Trespassing
Are you insane?
Let him go.
No Trespassing
My father bought this house.
Never do it again!
I'm not talking about that.
If you don't let him go now, I'm gonna get pissed off.
Come on, now. "Bastard" is a bit much, ain't it?
Calling someone you just met a bastard right in front of their house...
Do you even know how to talk to people?
Well, I know how to shut that mouth of yours.
Stab
What?!
Bro?!
Do you wanna know why I shot him with the arrow?
Because that guy is Josuke Higashikata.
Oh, really? He is?
A Stand user?! You two are Stand users?!
Okuyasu! Make Josuke Higashikata disappear!
Koichi...
Hmph! I was hoping I could make him into a Stand user
but I guess that's not happening.
He's gonna die.
M-Move!
I can still heal his wounds with my Shining Diamond!
No!
Josuke Higashikata! I, Okuyasu Nijimura, will make you disappear
Here we go!
If you don't move, I'm seriously going to mess up your face.
You're pretty fast.
Hey, Okuyasu.
Using a Stand is the same as driving a car or riding a bike.
Dipshits with no skill or guts
Bro...
Please don't say things that'll piss me off too much.
This bastard's much faster than I thought.
We're not messing around here, Okuyasu!
The Stand that you acquired, The Hand, gives me chills just thinking about it.
You'd better be serious when you use it.
Make sure you kill Josuke Higashikata, who defeated Angelo, no matter what!
He's bound to get in our way.
I know—
Ah! I was talking!
Th-That's not fair!
You're pretty stupid, aren't you?
What? Why?!
Why do you think tha—
I told you to move.
Koichi!
Thank goodness. You're still alive.
Then I can still save...
That's it! You're gonna pay for that!
I told you to move!
Get any closer and you'll really piss me off!
Take your best shot, if you can!
He's got way too much confidence in his right hand.
This isn't good.
I've got a really bad feeling about that right hand of his...
Let go of my right hand, you little shit!
Yeah, it's his right hand!
Swoop
Why, you...
Don't you dare run away, Josuke!
Don't abandon your friend like that!
There's something up with that right hand of yours.
Something's telling me it's not safe.
Think about that after you're dead!
Here I go!
Koichi... Just hang on a little longer...
No passing
What's with that gate? Something's wrong with it...
No... passing?
Stop walking backwards, you dumbass.
You're getting farther away from your buddy.
That's it... The "tres" is missing.
I bet your Stand's right hand
scraped it off, right?
No passing
That's right, Josuke Higashikata!
Whatever this right hand grabs gets scraped away.
And the parts that don't get scraped away...
close together, so it looks like nothing changed.
As for the part that gets scraped away...
Even I don't know where it ends up!
I can do this to guys who try to run away, too.
I scrape away the space between us! And then...
See? You came right to me.
You could call it teleporting!
This is the power of the Stand even my bro fears, The Hand!
Josuke!
No matter where you go, you're...
always...
within my reach!
So weak!
You really beat Angelo like this?
I guess you just don't get that it's no use.
You're the one who's stupid!
Now die, Josuke!
You really are stupid, aren't you?
Why?!
Smack
Crash
Kaboom
That was close. Okuyasu Nijimura, huh?
That's a pretty great and terrifying Stand.
I'll be in trouble if he wakes up and tries to attack.
I guess I should strangle him a bit, just to make sure he stays knocked out.
It'll put the feeling of defeat in his soul, too.
One, and...
K-Koichi's...
That's enough, you bastard!
This arrow is very precious. It's the only one there is.
It's my precious objective.
I just to retrieve it.
There's no doubt about it. That unleashed The World...
I've got to hurry and destroy that bow and arrow...
To make sure a villain more evil than DIO
Episode 4 The Nijimura Brothers, Part 2
Episode 4 mura Brothers, Part 2
This arrow is very precious. It's the only one there is.
It's my precious objective.
I just to retrieve it.
Don't you dare pull out that arrow! It'll make him bleed even more!
Because my little brother's an idiot, I have to kill you now.
Which means it won't be good if something happens to this arrow.
If the lady next door happens to see it, or if it snaps in half, that'd be bad news.
so I want to make sure I put the arrow away properly.
When you're listening to CDs, you properly put the first one away in its case
before listening to the second one, right?
Everyone's like that.
I'm like that, too.
Oh? You're gonna come into this house?
Think before you speak!
If I don't come in, I can't kick your ass and treat Koichi's wounds!
Bro! I haven't lost yet!
Hold off on attacking him!
Attack?
We ain't finished yet!
Something's coming from...
the darkness of the ceiling!
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 The Nijimura Brothers, Part 2
Okuyasu...
How stupid you are never ceases to amaze me.
my Worse Company would have attacked Josuke for sure.
And you actually walked into its attack trajectory.
Bro...
Your Stand, The Hand, is terrifying, but you're completely incompetent.
that incompetent people drag down everyone around them, didn't I?
I told you over and over that people only have the right to live
What's with his injuries?
What kind of attack makes you end up with wounds like that?
Anyway, it seems that something's up there.
I think it's only natural that morons like you should die!
It left a ton of holes again!
What kind of attack is that?
Shining Diamond!
Are you trying to attack your brother, too?!
Josuke Higashikata...
I'm sure he won't abandon this brat he called Koichi.
He'll most likely come in here again.
I'll kill him, no matter what...
no matter who they may be!
Now, then... How about you tell me about your brother's Stand?
Tell me what his Stand really is!
If you tell me, I'll treat your wounds.
Like hell... I'm gonna tell you...
Dumbass...
As I thought.
Well, then... I guess I have no choice!
I'm gonna go in there again, so just don't get in my way, Okuyasu.
Koichi doesn't have much time!
His Stand attacks from somewhere within this darkness.
Going in here is pretty dangerous.
I've got no choice but to use all of my senses fully...
Hey, wait a minute!
Huh?
Why, Josuke? Why did you treat my wounds?
Shut up. I'll tell you later.
I might attack you! I'm your enemy!
You want a piece of me?
After I hear your answer! Why did you treat my wounds?
I'm not very smart, so you're gonna have to tell me!
And that wound on your hand!
You got that when you were pulling me outside, didn't you?
I wanna know why you went through all that to save me.
There's no deep reason.
"There's no reason he has to die."
That's what I thought back there.
Koichi...
The trail leads upstairs.
I still have more questions, Josuke!
What's your problem?!
Why?!
Why don't you use your Stand's powers to fix your own hand?
You should just fix it up like you did with my face.
My Shining Diamond can't repair my own wounds.
It just means life isn't that easy.
I have no way of saving people who've already died.
Let me just say one thing, Okuyasu.
If Koichi dies, I don't know what I'm gonna do to your brother.
So don't hold it against me. It was your brother who caused all this trouble.
You got that? If you do, stay outside.
Koichi!
Damn it... This is definitely a trap.
He plans to attack me from somewhere as soon as I get close to Koichi.
But...
Even if I know it's a trap, I have no choice but to go!
Koichi doesn't even have seconds left!
What?!
Okuyasu, you bastard!
Josuke!
Gyaon
Koichi just...
Because I'm stupid, I just act on what's in my heart.
Just once, just this once, I'll repay my debt to you.
I won't do anything else.
This is it.
That's just great, Okuyasu.
Hey, you were in great danger, Koichi.
I'm glad you came to.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Five...
and then, uh... um...
Wh-Where are we?
That dangerous situation we were in earlier isn't over yet, Koichi.
but I wonder if Okuyasu's brother will let us do that safely...
There's definitely something up there.
Something's lurking in the shadows of the ceiling.
What's that?
Something really fast just went by.
Josuke, what's going on?
Koichi, I'm sure you have no idea what's going on right now.
For now, don't ask any questions, and get closer to me.
but I feel a bit more at ease now that I've seen it.
It just looks like a shrimp with very little power.
This battle's gonna end with me sending Shining Diamond
There you are!
What the heck? There's a ton of them!
And that uniform...
Burn
Wh-What's...
A bunch of guys that look like toy soldiers are falling...
Are these Okuyasu's brother's Stand?
Ow!
You bastard!
I guess attacking two or three won't do enough damage.
And the wounds are small, but their destructive power is the real thing.
We're sure to get seriously hurt if we fight these things.
my plan's been derailed.
But they won't be leaving this house...
Nor will they leave my Stand, Worse Company's, battlefield.
Wo
Wor
Worse
Worse Co
Worse Com
Worse Compa
Worse Company
Kei
Keicho
Keicho Niji
Keicho Nijimura
Worse Company?
Josuke, wh-what's...
Don't ask questions.
I'm sure you don't get it, but just shut up and stay back!
We're in real trouble right now!
All units, halt!
Ready, aim...
Fire!
Left face!
Fire!
As I thought, that's enough destructive power to blow off
Lucky! There are some windows.
I guess I was a bit naïve...
Just great... They have helicopters, too?
Those look like the American army's Apache helicopters.
Look out! There's a tank!
You're right. They have tanks, too.
Koichi, be caref—
What?
Wh-What did you just say, Koichi? Can you see them?
These soldiers, tanks, and helicopters...
You can see them clearly?
Yeah. I'm not sure what's going on, but I can see them.
Could it be that since you were shot by that arrow, you became a Stand user?
Oh? So the little shrimp
has the power to use a Stand now?
There you are, Okuyasu's big bro.
You've got some guts, showing yourself like that!
My Stand, Worse Company, has unbreakable defense.
It's an army that won't let any invader leave alive.
I'm sure you want to beat me...
But I can tell you right now that your Shining Diamond's attacks
will never reach me.
Look! Do you see my army's beautiful formation?
All units, maintain battle formation! At ease!
It feels so good when they're so beautifully together.
Though I'm a bit pissed off that their formation is
You sure are methodical.
No, the reason I came out here
is to watch you, brat.
M-Me?
That's right.
Koichi, was it?
Make your Stand appear right now, and show me what it can do.
You might have the ability that I've been looking for.
If you have that ability, I'll let you live.
B-But...
The ability you're looking for?
What the hell are you after?
You're in no position to be asking questions, Josuke!
My decision to kill you hasn't changed!
Be thankful that you get to live a bit longer.
That's just great.
Hey, what're you doing?
Make your Stand appear, brat!
S-Stand? I have no idea what's going on...
Oh? It's your first time? I see!
Fine! Josuke, show him how to make a Stand appear!
Your Shining Diamond's range is less than one meter.
you might be able to escape my Company.
True... It'd be great if it's a Stand that can kick your ass.
Okay, getting your Stand to come out is easy, Koichi.
You just need to feel like
Huh?
The rest is just instinct.
A Stand that's unique to your mentality should come out.
W-Wait! I can't understand all this out of nowhere!
You don't understand?
Do it, Green Beret!
Boom
What?!
That's...
Hey, Koichi, try moving it.
M-Move what?
That Stand!
Stand?
I-I made this appear?!
What happens after this?
What kind of abilities does this egg-shaped thing have?
Abilities? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is all I can do!
What? That's it?!
This Stand...
That's enough! That's all I need to know!
All units, battle positions!
Koichi, withdraw your Stand.
If they attack that thing, you'll die, too!
Withdraw? How do I make it withdraw?!
Commence attack!
Kablow
J-Josuke!
Good. Now Koichi and Josuke have been separated.
The crack in that egg...
The only one who's going to die right now is Josuke.
Ow...
I'm gonna do the same.
Let's make this .
Josuke Higashikata...
Is it true that you hate it when anyone says anything insulting about your hair?
Why don't you try insulting it? Just to test that out.
No, there's no need.
Because I'm going to declare that I'll
First, my Worse Company is going to shoot your legs.
You won't be able to run away then.
Next, we'll damage your arm.
Then you won't be able to guard yourself.
And then, I declare that I'm gonna blow your brains out, along with your hair.
I see. That's a flawless plan...
If you ignore the fact that it's impossible!
I'm very methodical, you see.
If I say I'll do something in a certain order, I will.
That's what a declaration is.
He's wide open...
I just need to make that Stand thing appear again.
I might be able to beat him!
I-I'm going to do it! Be confident!
I'm going to beat him!
so I won't kill you just yet.
You bastard!
All units, charge!
I'm gonna make my way through this army and beat you down!
Josuke Higashikata!
A l-landmine?!
First, damage to your legs!
And now, Apaches, fire your missiles!
My arm...
First your legs, then your arm.
Let's see if you can stay in one piece as my Worse Company
fires all its missiles, shells, and rounds into that damaged arm of yours!
You've lost, Josuke Higashikata!
All units!
Get ready to fire at once!
What do you think you're doing, Josuke Higashikata?
Are you surrendering?
Are you asking me to let you go?
That's not happening.
All units, fire!
My plan is already finished.
What?!
My missiles that just attacked Josuke's arm...
Did you forget?
If you forgot, then write it down. You know, methodically.

Episode 5 mura Brothers, Part 3
My plan is already finished.
What?!
Okuyasu's big bro was a pretty great danger.
Koichi, let's get the heck out of this house.
Huh?
Wh-What about the bow and arrow that sh-shot me?
The bow and arrow?
Are we going to look for them?
Y-Yeah...
You know, I could swear they mentioned having a dad around.
I took some pretty major damage, so let's just leave for today.
W-We can't!
I-I'm alive because you healed my wounds for me, but...
Here in this town!
S-Stay here. I-I'll go look for them myself!
N-Not to mention, I don't think their dad is here right now.
I-If he was, I'm s-sure he would have shown himself by now.
He's a lot braver than he looks.
He can be tough when it counts... Or maybe just reckless.
But right now, we should really hurry up and get out of this house.
Hey...
Wh-What? D-Don't try to stop me.
I won't.
Koichi.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 The Nijimura Brothers, Part 3
They have an attic. Maybe the bow and arrow are up here.
Th-There they are!
The bow and arrow!
Hey, I think this was a bad idea. There's something in there.
Is something chained up in there?
I-Is it a dog?
I-It sounds like an animal.
No, I'm scared! What should we do?!
What should we do?
Yeah, but...
We're just gonna have to do this.
Listen up, Koichi.
We're gonna scare it.
Then, I'm gonna run over and snap the bow and arrow in half.
Got it?
Yeah.
Here we go.
One...
Two...
Three!
Grab
What the hell is that?!
Koichi!
Help!
That hand doesn't belong to a Stand. It's real!
That's a real body!
H-Help me!
Bleh...
I didn't mean to chop it off...
Wh-What the heck is that creature?
I can't believe that thing's been living near my house...
Bleh...
Looks like you finally saw the thing you weren't supposed to see.
You bastard...
That thing right there... is our dad.
My dad needs these.
Th-The bow and arrow...
I want to find a Stand user for my dad's sake.
That's why I can't let anyone else
no matter what!
Is it some kind of disease?
Disease? No.
and he's got an appetite.
But he just keeps moaning, and he doesn't recognize me as his son.
So you were looking for a Stand user to fix your dad.
Fix?
It's the opposite.
I'm looking for a Stand user who'll kill my dad.
Dad won't die, no matter what.
I just want to let him die normally.
I swore when I was a kid that I'd do anything to make that happen.
And to do that, I need this bow and arrow.
Otherwise, my dad will probably live like this forever.
Because my dad had some guy named DIO's cells
DIO? Did you just say DIO?
That's the guy Jotaro talked about.
After all, you're not completely uninvolved.
Everything happened eleven years ago, in 1988.
At the time, I was seven, and Okuyasu was four.
We lived in Tokyo.
but at the time, my dad had no luck.
Nijimura Land
and he was in massive debt.
He would hit us for no reason all the time.
Our dad was a total loser.
money started rolling in to my dad.
Even jewels and precious metals, too, sometimes.
He wasn't even really working.
I found out later when I did some research
that my dad had apparently already sold his soul to DIO.
He became one of his minions in exchange for money.
It seems that DIO was looking for anyone with Stand potential back then.
though I have no idea now what his Stand was like.
But one day... Even though it was ten years ago, I still remember it vividly.
When I got home from school, around 2:00 PM...
Okuyasu!
Did Dad hit you again? That scum!
N-No!
Huh?
DIO...
DIO's dead...
Dad?
Dad, let's call an ambulance.
It's no use! This isn't an illness!
I'm done for!
Dad!
About a year after that, he became a glob of flesh that can't even tell
and order them around when he wanted to control them.
Dad had one of those flesh buds implanted in his head.
I spent ten years researching everything.
About Stands, about Jotaro...
Because DIO's immortal cells had become one with him.
This is all he does, all day long.
Every single day...
he uselessly scratches around that box of junk.
If I take the box away from him, he just cries for days.
It pisses me off.
How many times have I told you not to make a mess?
but he never stops digging around in that box!
Hey! You're the one who needs to stop!
He's your dad!
Yeah, that's right.
He's my father by blood.
But right now, he's as much my father as he's not.
He's a man who sold his soul to DIO, and got what he deserved.
That's exactly why I want him to die normally.
Once he's finally dead, my life can actually begin!
Damn it! I told you to stop that!
Hey!
That's enough!
I can't let you have this bow and arrow.
No matter what!
Don't get the wrong idea!
Right now, that box has my attention!
Dogyaa
Do
Th-The box?
gyaa
I see now.
A family photo...
S-So there was a reason.
He was looking for the photo of his sons at the time.
but deep down inside, he still has his memories!
Memories of the past!
The
The Ha
The Han
The Hand
Oku
Okuyasu
Okuyasu Niji
Okuyasu Nijimura
I don't mind helping you out.
But hand over that bow and arrow.
You planning to run?
Big Bro, let's stop this.
Okuyasu!
Come on, let's stop all of this, okay?
You were still here?
Dad might get cured, right?
maybe his mind and his memories will go back to how he used to be.
Okuyasu! What do you think you're holding?
Big Bro...
Out of the way, Okuyasu!
I've already killed so many people in this city with this bow and arrow!
Besides, I don't even think of you as my little brother anymore.
Since you're not my little brother, I can kill you without hesitation!
B-Big Bro...
You guys...
Do you have any relatives here besides your dad?
Relatives? There's only the three of us.
Th-That's...
It came out of the electrical outlet...
Okuyasu! Stop spacing out, you dumbass!
Big Bro!
I'm taking this bow and arrow, Keicho Nijimura!
I, who got shot by this bow and arrow, and had my Stand ability awakened!
You think...
Keicho Nijimura!
Well, I've grown!
How else do you think my Stand, Chili Pepper, grew this much?
Worse Company!
Shut up!
Th-That's...
Electricity!
Big Bro!
Don't touch me!
You'll be dragged in, too!
Big Bro...
D-Damn it! It's taking the bow and arrow!
Okuyasu...
You were always holding me back!
Big Bro!
Josuke!
I could have sworn I just saw someone who looked like
the user looking in through that window.
Do you know anything about that Stand we just saw, Okuyasu?
N-No. My big bro found a lot of Stand users I didn't know about.
J-Josuke! Th-That's...
Okuyasu...
My big bro... deserved to end up like that.
There's no way he could have lived a decent life.
That was his fate.
But you know...
In the very end, my big bro defended me, didn't he?
Josuke, you saw it, right?
Yeah. I definitely saw it.
Your big bro defended you.
Is this Jotaro Kujo?
I don't recognize your voice.
That doesn't matter.
Jotaro Kujo, I'm asking you to leave Morioh.
I don't think I'll listen to someone
Would you leave, no questions asked, if you were in my shoes?
I'm the one who has the bow and arrow.
I got it after I killed Keicho Nijimura.
I don't mind killing you either, Jotaro, but I hear that
Are you also Stand user?
I don't plan on giving you any trouble.
Unavailable Number Public Phone
I just received this Stand ability.
I'm fed up with my annoying life of entrance exams and getting a job.
Are you a student?
What difference does that make?!
How many other Stand users are in this city?
Good grief...
The stolen bow and arrow remain missing.
Nijimura Family
Okuyasu Nijimura decided to settle down
And...
Josuke, would you get that?
Yes?
Hey, Josuke! Let's go to school.
Huh?
I'll be going to the same school as you starting today.
Even so, you don't have to come and get me.
Man, I had no idea your house was, like, right in front of mine!
Yeah, you could call that a shocking truth...
Come on. Let's hurry up and go.
Oh, is that a friend of yours, Josuke?
Hi! I'm Okuyasu Nijimura!
Come on in and have a cup of coffee while he finishes getting ready.
Really? Thank you very much!
Your mom is totally hot.
Pardon the intrusion!
This is just great... and heavy...

Episode 6 ichi Hirose (Reverb)
Poco, where in blazes were you at this hour?!
D-Dad...
I'm glad you're safe, b-but where's Sis?
She went out to look for you.
She... She went out?!
Poco, what's the matter? You're acting strange.
Sis!
Sis!
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 8: Blood Feud - JoJo & Dio
Think about this.
Take this lovely flower.
Your youth is blooming just like this flower is.
Consider this carefully, mademoiselle.
If this flower blooms fully, it will only wither away.
A shame, don't you think?
She's sweet sixteen! So pure and innocent!
Look at how full of delicious life energy she is, Lord Dio!
Those without manners aren't fit to live.
So, mademoiselle...
I offer you a choice.
Wouldn't you like to enjoy your youth for all eternity?
However, I will not force my friendship upon you, unlike some.
You are free to choose your own destiny.
Devil.
What's that you said?
You're just a damned d-devil!
Alas. Though you will soon part, allow me to introduce my companion.
This is the dreaded Doobie.
Since I am not to your taste, you might enjoy his company.
Bye, mademoiselle.
W-Who's there?!
Who indeed?
There's no need for introductions to a zombie!
Sis!
Poco!
Bit you! Bit you!
What's lurking under his mask?
L-Look at that!
That zombie is full of snakes!
Surprised, are you?
Those snakes bit his face, and not just once!
How troublesome.
I don't have time for Dio's games!
Impressive. He squeezed out the poison.
He's learned a lot about blood flow in a very short time.
It's because Baron Zeppeli gave him his life energy before he died.
I'll use a bit of Hamon to boil the blood of those snakes!
Sis!
Poco!
Sis!
I'm back from hell, Dio.
Still alive, JoJo?
I suppose that means you've defeated my two knights.
Lord Dio, we await your order to eliminate him!
I'll let my fangs make an impression on him!
Dio!
No. This one...
This one I will handle personally.
Allow me to be frank, JoJo.
I didn't want to have to do this personally.
We were raised in the same house.
That's why I left this business to my knights.
But in the end, I underestimated you.
Seeing you alive makes me realize I was too soft of an emperor.
Now I will slaughter you without a hint of hesitation!
Same here. I'll feel no guilt for killing you!
By the way, what happened
Did he run off?
Dio, I must express my feelings.
...truth be told, I, Jonathan Joestar, will kill you to satisfy my anger!
Come, JoJo!
Come, JoJo!
Dire!
JoJo, stand aside.
I have the right to satisfy my anger first.
Zeppeli was a companion through two decades of harsh training.
Dio, I will send you straight to the bowels of hell!
Wait! He has hidden abilities you don't know about!
What an interesting walk.
With enough training, humans are able
But in just one night, I have gained power beyond any human guru!
You think you can beat me with such sleepy movements?!
You fell for it, fool!
Thunder Cross Split Attack!
Incredible! By crossing his arms
It's a perfect stratagem!
No fighter has escaped it.
He's...!
Useless! Useless! Useless!
I-I can't move!
He's been flash frozen!
Dio vaporized the moisture in his body, turning him to ice in an instant!
Dire can't send Hamon into Dio unless his blood is flowing!
That Dio is truly fearsome! He froze Dire's whole body at once!
Y-You...
So feeble!
You thought you would ever be able to touch me, fool?!
You came here just to die like a dog!
I'll give them all a good show!
- D-Dire! - Stop!
JoJo, it's time.
You're the next one to be sent to oblivion!
Dire!
A Hamon-filled rose's thorns do sting.
Dire!
How...
How dare you scar my face?!
Dire...
Speedwagon!
Here!
Dio, I've just seen the way to beat your flash freezing.
I know how to send Hamon into you.
I'll fill Blueford's sword of luck and pluck with Hamon and slice you!
You dare touch me...
You dare touch me with your Hamon filthier than frog urine?!
You've pushed your luck too far!
Now you'll be a feast for my zombies!
They'll gnaw the faces off your skulls!
Now he shows his true colors as the worst man in the world!
His cool sophistication is nothing but a cheap mask!
Now that he's had a humiliating taste of Hamon, we see his real face!
I will show you no mercy!
I am Pajyu!
Jones!
Pluton!
Barnum!
Needle Vein Strike!
Roses are living things, so Hamon will remain inside of them.
But steel is different.
I have to maintain contact.
There is a great horde of them.
I'll handle them for you.
As far as I can tell, Dio is as swift as a leopard.
Thanks to Baron Zeppeli, Jonathan just might keep up.
But Dio is strong enough to pulverize flesh and bone with ease!
The battle will be decided as they meet in the opening moment!
I'll squeeze the life out of you!
I'll cleanse the world of your evil!
H-He grabbed some roses when I wasn't looking!
Now!
W-Wow!
He circled to Dio's right because that eye can't see!
D-Damn! JoJo is a veteran fighter!
Y-Yes!
He finally defeated Dio!
I-I...
I'm frozen!
So feeble!
Now you will become one of my children of the night!
I've got your rubbery carotid between my fingers!
So warm and springy. What a pleasant feeling.
A kick!
My legs are frozen, too!
Useless! Useless! Useless!
Enjoy this anguish, JoJo!
Move and this delicate blood vessel will snap!
I'll open your carotid and exchange your blood for my vampiric essence.
W-We have to help!
Zombies!
Keep those peasants back for a moment.
They just won't stop coming.
We won't be able to help.
Now, JoJo, I'll fill you with vampiric essence and make you my slave!
Don't think you've won, Dio! You've made a fatal mistake!
And how so?
You haven't frozen me completely because you are still feeding.
Your tactics are flawed!
He put the sword in the flame!
That blade is conducting the heat faster than I can freeze it!
Hamon is coming up the blade!
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
Take this!
He got him!
Look again! You can tell that the Hamon didn't go through.
My arm...
My arm is frozen again!
I only touched his face!
You underestimated me, JoJo!
I will admit it. I admire your explosive tenacity.
I must say that your use of fire was marvelous.
But JoJo, nothing can escape my icy grasp.
Just a touch on the arm is enough.
I can freeze your whole body in two seconds.
He squeezed out the vampiric essence!
Jonathan hasn't given up yet!
Why are you puffed up like that? Still looking for a fight?
No matter how you struggle, human ability is limited.
Your Hamon training is useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
A monkey cannot stand against a human!
And compared to me, you are a mere monkey, JoJo!
Wrong! With enough conviction, humans can do anything!
Humans will grow! Let me demonstrate!
You won't, because you'll be a zombie!
His hand, it's burning!
His glove is on fire!
It just might get through Dio's ice!
Which one of us will fall in the end?!
We find out now, Dio!
H-He was blocked!
No!
He's breaking through!
I'm disintegrating!
The pain! The burning!
My reign...was supposed... to last...for centuries!
You had to be destroyed, Dio.
I won't...
He shot his essence from his eye!
He was centimeters from incinerating my brain!
T-That was close!
The last throes of a demon clinging to life in this world.
Dio's falling down the cliff!
Dio...
He's fainted!
He's worn out. He should be.
He's seen too many fatal fights tonight.
But why would he cry after killing a bad guy like that?
He spent his youth together with Dio.
But me? I can smile happily!
Are you watching, Baron Zeppeli? He did it!
Jonathan finally did it!
Dio is dead.
It may sound like an exaggeration, but the world is saved!
Next episode
What a joyous occasion!
These are tears of joy.
R-Run...
I want to stay like this forever.
Is my new body here?
Chapter 9: The Last Hamon
This is Morioh Radio.
Your host, once again, is me, your neighbor, Kai Harada.
Now, then...
Look at those smooth spokes shining as they spin!
Last week's topic was, "The King of Terror is supposed to come from the sky this July.
This mountain bike was a gift to celebrate me getting into high school.
What are the citizens of Morioh going to do?"
Getting new stuff is always exciting.
All right, let's get to the replies.
This one's from "RIP Big Bro."
I'm not gonna be able to take the bus to school for a while!
I wonder what happened to his big bro?
O-Ow...
Wh-What the heck?
There's a bag in the middle of the road.
I-It can't be! The thing in that bag was...
Wh-What am I gonna do?! I ran it over!
I-I couldn't help it!
There was nothing I could've done!
Precisely.
You're not the one at fault here.
That was just an unfortunate accident.
The guy who put the kitten in a bag and left it in the road is at fault.
Talk about a terrible thing to do.
W-We have to treat its injuries!
It's no use.
You don't hear it crying, do you?
It's dead.
What's your name?
My name's Tamami Kobayashi, and I graduated from
That's a nice bike.
You a first-year?
Y-Yes. My name's Koichi Hirose.
Ah, high school, eh? Takes me back.
Things were good back then.
Well, have a seat, Hirose.
Huh? B-But...
Just shut up and sit down.
So... I've got an idea.
so give me a little money. Okay?
Hey! Are you listening?!
Wh-What are you talking about?
Hey, now. Quit messing around.
Did you say it was your cat?
That's right.
Y-You put the kitten o-over there?
That's not the problem anymore.
I'm asking you if you're really gonna do nothing about it and go.
You're the one that killed it, bro.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Koichi Hirose (Reverb)
Hey, you're feeling guilty, right?
If your heart could be freed
Wouldn't it be better to just pay up?
Right?
Money
Wh-What's this lock-looking thing?!
It's heavy!
Huh? You can see that?
Then this should go even faster, Hirose.
Th-This is a Stand!
A Stand's inside my body!
Hey, Josuke.
Isn't that Koichi standing over there?
Yeah, that's definitely Koichi.
That kid hangs out with shady-looking characters all the time.
But he looks like he's having fun.
I had no idea what was going on, but man, I was happy.
Now...
Come on, cough it up.
These shackles won't come off if you don't pay up.
I-I don't...
have any money.
Huh... You looked away just now, didn't you?
W-Well...
I-It's heavy!
I can't even stand anymore!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It's not nice to lie, you know.
You felt bad about lying, didn't you?
The more guilt you feel, the bigger the lock becomes.
These shackles are the weight of your sins.
Even if I'm sleeping, or if you try to run far away, it's never coming off.
All right? If you get it, then show me your wallet.
Come on.
What the heck? You should have just given me this in the first place.
You have 7,000 yen!
Th-That's for buying sneakers for gym class today.
Sneakers?
Go barefoot!
What are you doing over there?
J-Josuke and Okuyasu!
A grown man trying to threaten a high school kid for money?
Try getting a job to earn your money.
Now, look! You little boys stay out of this!
Oh, we can't do that.
Not when there's some smelly trash around, using some petty Stand.
We've got to take out that trash properly.
Hey...
This seriously isn't coming off.
Whoa, wait... You guys can see it, too?
Just how many of you can see that?
That's what I want to know.
But right now, that doesn't matter.
Would you kindly take that lock off of him?
Hey, you little brats! Don't underestimate me!
I'm not playing games here!
Sinners must pay for their sins. That's the rule of society.
Or what? You're going to pay me instead of Koichi?
Then I'll let you off the hook.
Money's money to me.
Oh? You're gonna try to get money from me?
Just try it, damn it!
Wait! You just took 7,000 yen for me!
That was the fee for lying to me!
Huh?!
You're trying to pay for that poor kitten's life with just 7,000 yen?
That just won't do.
I'll take about five hundred grand for that.
Five hundred grand?!
Come on, five hun—
Shut up, you little shit!
O-Okuyasu!
Hey, don't push it.
Shut yer trap, you dumbass.
We told you to give his 7,000 yen back, so give it back, you dipshit!
Slip
O-Ow! My front tooth!
Wh-Why the hell did you wobble around and fall over on your own?
On my own? That's so cruel!
How dare you say that after hitting me?!
My front tooth's gone. You're so cruel!
H-Hey, wait a sec... Are you okay?
Wait, Okuyasu...
Don't feel any guilt toward him!
H-He did it on purpose!
Front teeth are pretty expensive, you know...
Since I don't have insurance.
Wh-Why, you...
Whoa, now! Don't try anything funny with me.
it goes right back to that lock.
Y-You bastard...
Hey. Is the kitten that you said Koichi ran over
this thing?
A s-stuffed animal?
Here, let me see. I picked up your front tooth for you.
It's all better.
It's gone!
Yay! My heart feels so much lighter now!
Wh-Who the hell are you?!
Hey, aren't you forgetting the 7,000 yen?
All right! I'll give it back.
Once the money's down, hurry up and get out of here, dumbass!
I-I'm saved... Ah!
Th-The bills... H-He took them!
He took the big parts that the bank would exchange!
Th-That bastard...
Unforgivable! Even if it's not my money.
Damn. I was only able to get 7,000 yen.
Don't think you're gonna get away with that.
Just you wait.
Aw, man...
I'm home, Police.
Hey, you alive? Woof, woof.
I'm home.
I've heard all about you around town, ma'am.
They say you're beautiful, kind, and so refined.
You can't be serious.
I wouldn't lie!
Really?
Of course!
Wh-Why is he in my house rubbing my mom's shoulders?!
The
The Lock
Tama
Tamami
Tamami Koba
Tamami Kobayashi
Y-You!
What are you doing here?!
Oh, Ko, you're back. Hi!
I-I asked you wh-what you were doing here!
This gentleman delivered the money you dropped.
Huh?!
Seven thousand yen. You must've been in a hurry.
Th-This money... You told her you found it?
That's right. You ran into Mr. Kobayashi on your bike today, didn't you?
Wha...
I made sure you got your money back, Koichi.
A-And you should have!
Ko, why are you so worked up?
but it appears that I dropped my wallet when we ran into each other, too.
It looks just like this one.
Which means our wallets got swapped.
Do you understand what I'm saying, ma'am?
Y-Yes, though that seems very unusual.
But I guess it's possible.
So I'd like you to tell Koichi to return my wallet to me.
It had about five hundred thousand yen in it.
Please tell him to give it back to me.
What?!
F-Five hundred thousand?!
So that's it!
I see your scheme now!
K-Ko...
Don't panic! He's a con artist!
They're all lies!
Oh, that's right.
Last night, I had a hamburger combo at Jonny's.
And... Oh, yes. I added an order of onion gratin soup...
So I believe the total on the receipt was 1,833 yen.
It should be tucked away in the wallet Koichi has.
K-Ko!
N-No! Mom, please believe me!
This is a trick!
You did this earlier, didn't you?!
And then you went out of your way to buy a similar wallet!
I hate to say this, but your son, though I'm sure it's just a phase, is pretty rotten.
Don't you feel guilty as his mother
for raising a son like that?
Stop!
M-Mom!
I finally did it!
Now the weight of her guilt won't allow her heart to be free.
I'm gonna take you for everything you've got.
First, I'll take this house's land, title, and seal.
What a great house this is.
is something wrong?
Sis!
Wh-What?!
and then acted like it really burned. She kept apologizing so much.
She was so cute and sexy.
So she's a third-year at a girls' school?
R-Ripe for the picking.
A-A-Awesome!
How dare you?
You won't get away with this! I won't let you!
What the hell?
What's up with that puny egg thing?
What the hell is that?!
Mom, Sis, please leave the room for a while.
Ko, what's happening?
Please, don't ask any questions now.
Hey! K-Keep that thing away from me!
Your mom and sister leaving the room
I won't let you harm my mom or sister.
J-Just try it, Koichi! Just try!
Take the locks off of them!
I told you to take them off!
Don't underestimate Tamami Kobayashi, you pissy little shit!
L-Like hell I'll take them off!
Crack!
Huh? What?
That didn't hurt.
Huh?
Smack!
Whoa! What's this?
What the hell is with your Stand?
It doesn't have any speed or power at all!
How dare you scare me like that, you dumbass?!
I'll show you that a Stand's strength comes from how strong you are mentally!
Crack!
Which means your mental strength is zero!
I'm gonna make sure you pay dearly for this!
S-Something strange is going on with his cheek!
"Cr-ack"?
It looks like a manga sound effect.
Crack!
Crack! Crack! Crack!
Wh-What the heck? I hear a weird ringing in my ears!
Like the sound I heard when I got hit...
Smack
What the hell is this writing on my arm?!
I-It won't come off!
Smack! Smack! Smack!
Crack! Crack! Crack!
Smack! Smack! Smack!
Crack! Crack! Crack!
W-Wait... Th-These sounds that I hear coming from inside me...
Your Stand did that?!
Damn it! Get rid of this sound!
Smack
Boom!
Boom!
Smack!
Crack!
It's the sound.
C-Come to think of it, there was that famous Basho Matsuo poem I learned at school...
So quiet and still The shrill of the cicadas Seeps into the rocks
the shrill of the cicadas
seeps into the rocks."
Smack!
Crack!
Boom!
Damn it! I totally fell for it!
If you take the locks off my mom and sister, I'll stop the sound.
Stop this sound!
Dogyaa
Stop being stubborn and take off those locks!
Damn it! How dare you do this to me?!
Smack!
Crack!
Boom!
Dogyaa!
Like I could threaten and con if I was afraid of a little brat like you!
The "Tama" in my name means "ballsy"! I'll show you just how ballsy I am!
I'm not scared of some knife!
Don't take me lightly!
The true fear of the locks!
Ow!
What?!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Make the cut shallow, and scream like hell!
Toss!
"Toss"?
What was that scream?
What's wrong?
Ko?!
I-It's not what it looks like!
C-Crap!
Yes!
K-Ko! How could you do something so terrifying?!
No, Mom! t's not what it looks like!
No!
Sis!
I win! You lose!
Hurry up and stop this sound, Koichi!
I-I can't... anymore!
Mom!
I can't live any longer!
Stop acting tough!
No, I won't stop the sound.
I'll do the opposite, and make more sound!
Believe in me!
Believe in me!
What?!
!em ni eveileB
Believe in me, Mom!
Believe in me!
Believe!
Mom!
Believe in me!
Believe in me!
This is a matter of the soul! Like hell she'll believe you!
Mom...
then who will?
Koichi's always been a nice boy.
He would never hurt anyone or take their money.
Yes!
Sh-Shit!
Mom!
D-Damn it!
Usually, they'd never believe...
It was just a joke!
Ko, it was all just a joke!
Take the lock off my sister, too.
It's already off!
We can't do anything to harm her beauty, right?
I was only kidding about taking your house!
I even gave back your 7,000 yen, didn't I? Right? Right?
Please forgive me! I'll do anything, Master Koichi!
What? You'll do anything?
Yes, Master Koichi! Anything! I'll be your underling!
All right, then...
Make sure you bring me five hundred grand by tomorrow.
It's a joke. It's only a little joke.
Th-That didn't sound like a joke!
H-Hey, Okuyasu! What the hell is going on here?
Allow me to carry your bag to school!
You're seriously going to carry it?
But of course!
Master Koichi! You're a true man among men!
Oh, stop it.
Hey, Okuyasu!
Don't ask me! I'm not smart, remember?
Episode 7 Toshikazu Hazamada (Show Off)
Episode 7 mada (Show Off)
This is Morioh Radio, and our next segment is
"Help Me, Midnight Discussions!"
Our first letter is from "Forever 21, Pretty Baby."
"Listen to this, Kai.
I was late meeting someone because of that thing again.
Yeah, the one by the station!
The railroad crossing that never lets you through.
Ugh, it just goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding... It just needs to shut up!"
Now, calm down, Pretty Baby.
Oh...
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
See ya.
Seriously?
 Toshikazu Hazamada (Show Off)
There are Stand users besides us at this school?
Yeah. He's Toshikazu Hazamada, a student in class 3-C.
This Hazamada guy apparently got into
One of them had insulted the other's favorite idol or anime or something.
That night, surprisingly, the friend he got into the argument with
gouged out his own left eye with a mechanical pencil.
Isn't that insane?
Apparently Hazamada's friend said this at the hospital:
"Next thing I knew, I was staring at my left eye, which I'd gouged out, with my right eye."
So you're saying that this guy gouged out
Could be, but maybe not.
Normal people can't see Stands.
Something about this is really fishy.
What'd you say?!
I've got a real job now, y'know!
Huh? You've got a job?
Yes, Master Koichi! I found myself a little job that involves financing.
Financing?
You don't mean you became a loan shark, do you?
Well... It's a very reputable establishment, though!
Still, though, we can't just ignore this.
Wait up, Josuke!
M-Master Koichi!
Just leave it to that idiot Josuke.
There's something scary going on in my town.
So even if it's scary, I gotta do something!
Wh...
What a tough thing to say.
Nothing less from the man I've chosen to admire!
But...
I'll be heading home now!
Be safe, Master Koichi!
Yeah, totally.
Looks like he's not in the classroom.
But if that Hazamada guy really did gouge out his friend's eye
and can still blend into normal school life...
He must be one creepy guy.
Hazamada
H-Hey, Josuke!
I'm gonna check out his locker. Watch my back, Koichi.
Tell me first before you break it!
For starters... His bag is still here.
So he's still at school. Be careful.
R-Right.
So he's in the tennis club and likes manga.
Still, this guy's got way too much stuff.
I don't think the bow and arrow would be in here, but...
What's this wooden thing?
A Sta—
N-No... This is a physical object.
Is this one of those dolls they sell at art stores for sketching?
It scared me...
Huh?!
What? Why?!
It turned into me when I touched it.
But now we know for sure...
Hazamada is a Stand user!
This is just great. You've got some nerve, turning into me!
You've heard of , right?
I-It talked! It sounds and talks just like him!
You know the copy robot from ?
Isn't that thing convenient?
Don't you think it'd be great to have one around?
Hey, Koichi. What is he talking about?
You haven't heard of ?! I can't believe it.
Shut up! I'm the one asking the questions here!
M-My arm!
Josuke!
But mine is a copy doll that replicates people I don't want around.
Once it copies you, you'll mimic all of its movements.
but a puppet master!
K-Koichi! Move!
Crunch
Koichi!
And one rag's been hung out to dry.
Oh, but I'm not the one who did it. The one who did it was you, his friend.
Stuff like this
pisses me off more than anything.
but use others to do things for you.
That makes me want to kick your ass like nothing else!
That's just great. Tee-hee!
Looks like you're out of range.
Josuke, you stand no chance against me!
This Stand's name is Show Off.
By possessing a doll, it has gained a physical form...
Which means even normal people can see it.
Hazamada! You bastard!
My goal is to beat the shit out of Jotaro Kujo
and run him out of this city.
He's got some nerve!
But I heard that his Star Platinum can stop time for a second or two.
There's no one in our group that stands a chance against him.
That is, no one besides my Show Off, now that it's copied you, Josuke!
I'll have to knock you out now.
The genuine article would just be in the way.
Squish!
Crushed, huh? That's a satisfying sound.
As long as you didn't cut the nerve, you'll be able to see again...
If you're lucky.
Looks like he's gonna be out for a while.
Hey! Pick up my bag.
We're gonna go straight after Jotaro.
Easy enough.
I'm pretty sure the hotel that Jotaro's staying at is...
Squish!
Squish!
Uh...
The Morioh Grand Hotel.
Yeah, that's the one.
K-Koichi!
Koichi!
J-Josuke, are you okay?
Th-Thanks... But man, you've really got some guts.
Even though you're hurt, you managed to use your Stand to trick him.
What are you talking about?
as soon as I got hit, you fixed my broken bones with Shining Diamond.
And, uh...
I'd appreciate it if you could fix the injuries I got from breaking down
R-Right!
Hello, this is the Morioh Grand Hotel.
Oh, uh, could you put me through to Jotaro Kujo in Room 324?
Certainly.
Ugh! We have to hurry up and tell Jotaro about that Stand!
Thank you for waiting.
The line for Room 324 is currently in use.
Please wait until the current call is completed.
The line's in use?
What?!
Of course! It must've been the copy!
It called him before I did!
Are you certain, Josuke?
Yup! I'll tell you the details at Morioh Station.
Please come to the station plaza.
You should be able to get there in fifteen minutes.
All right. In front of the station in fifteen minutes.
Too easy.
I-It's no use! He's not answering.
He must have left the room.
Damn it! We're just gonna have to go after the copy!
I really couldn't tell the difference between you and the copy.
Yeah. What really creeped me out
wasn't when I saw its face. It was the fingers.
You see your fingers more often every day than your face, right?
I could tell that it had copied me right down to my fingerprints.
Oh!
Josuke, you're early.
Where's Master Koichi?
H-Hazamada?!
What are you doing here?
Tamami Kobayashi?
You don't know why we're together?
N-No, I don't...
No idea at all?
No idea! Why?!
Then...
Good!

Bye-bye, Josuke!
See you tomorrow!
Bye!
Josuke!
Bye, Josuke!
Why the hell are you the only one they say goodbye to?
I've never had anyone say that to me.
All the girls in this school are ugly, anyhow.
Josuke...
Hey, read this.
B-Bye.
Why the hell did you accept that? Rip this stupid thing up!
Damn it... What the hell is the difference between you and me?
Why does that even matter?
Wha...
You don't have any time to waste, do you?
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!
Ow!
You scraped your hand? That was dumb.
I'm made of wood, remember?
Shut up! Get away from me!
Damn it, I'm getting pissed off.
It's my own Stand, but this happens every time.
so I never even got anywhere.
Doesn't anyone in this world have a decent personality? Damn it!
That stupid Josuke!
then I'll crush him to bits!
I can't wait!
My bike!
It's dirty.
Damn it, that dumbass! I'll kill him!
Hey, it's not like he meant it. And he'll hear you.
Like I care! That's exactly why I said it.
Wobbling around like that...
Man, he looks like a dying cricket.
That's a good metaphor! I like it!
Yeah? It was a good description, huh?
Huh? What?
Hold him, Show Off.
I'll carve him up myself.
Wh-What are you doing?
You don't have to worry about that.
I'm just going to make sure
S-Stop!
A shard of glass?
J-Josuke Higashikata?!
Why... And the shrimp, too?
We finally caught up with you, asshole!
But did you already forget?
When you come face to face with Show Off, you become a puppet, Josuke!
Control him, Show Off!
Don't be so sure about that.
Wha... That shape...
I didn't throw that shard to hit you.
I threw it so I could put it back in its original form!
Swoosh
M-My right hand!
It turned back into wood!
This isn't good, Hazamada!
Calm down!
No one will notice!
The real problem is
that Jotaro should arrive at the station soon!
but let's give up on beating him right now!
H-Hazamada! Wait for me!
I see...
J-Josuke, we have no time to waste!
The way they went is the fastest way to get to the station!
And that's why I've got you, Koichi.
Looks like Josuke's not here yet.
Can you see Josuke anywhere?
Nope.
If I see any sign of him, I'll just take control of him.
Don't worry!
Ding Ding Ding Ding
Hazamada! A train's coming through.
The railroad crossing that never lets you through!
We'll have to wait a minute or two...
All right. We'll go through the station building.
Emergency Stop Button
No Crossing
Even if he catches up with us, the train will stall Josuke!
Just one more minute!
I won!
Huh?
That's Josuke!
Wh-What happened to the train?!
Why's the crossing open?!
Hazamada, look!
Wh-What the hell is that Stand?!
Ding Ding Ding Ding
That was great! You see? That's why I said I've got you.
Ah! There he is!
J-Jotaro! It's me, Josuke!
Hey.
We made it in time!
We got Hazamada good, didn't we, Josuke?
Did something happen?
A copy?
A Stand that copied you down to your fingerprints?
That's right!
But now we can relax.
That copy bastard is missing his right hand, so it'll be easy.
I blew off his right hand.
Use that to tell us apart.
All right.
They should get here at any moment.
Huh? Why do I have this thing?
Why did I get a pen out of Jotaro's pocket?
I-I can't move!
O-On the other side of the glass...
Josuke Higashikata...
You're gonna stab Jotaro in the head with that pen and kill him instantly.
After all, if his death isn't instant, your Shining Diamond will just fix him.
Josuke! This is your fault for getting outta line!
I was just gonna halfway kill Jotaro to chase him out of town.
But now you're the one who'll kill Jotaro!
It'll be all your fault!
Now! Let him have it, Show Off!
J-Jotaro...
You bastard!
Something wrong, Josuke?
Huh? No...
Looks like those guys finally found Hazamada.
You little shit!
You were just across the pedestrian bridge at the station, just like that Josuke said.
He's a great guy.
He treated our wounds, and I'm not even sure how, but they're all better!
I'll make sure I pay you back in full for earlier.
Let's take a little trip behind the restroom.
That Stand is pretty terrifying if it catches you.
Well, I guess I'll break this doll now.
It'll make me feel better.
Tamami was admitted to the hospital.
What a fool!
Well, you have my condolences.
Episode 8 Yukako Yamagishi Falls In Love, Part 1
Episode 8 , Part 1
So that guy, Hazamada, says
he doesn't know anything about the electric bastard
that killed my big bro?
Yeah. He said he's only ever talked to him on the phone.
And you believed him, Josuke? Did you torture him?
he would probably have already come to silence him.
R-Right... Just like my big bro.
Yeah. Seeing as how Hazamada is alive, that proves he really doesn't know.
But Hazamada did say this...
They say that you're bound to the person that you're going
It's sort of like that.
or someone who just moved in next door.
You just don't know.
Morioh's not very big...
but no matter how they try to hide, they'll eventually show themselves.
He knows that's going to happen eventually.
He wants you to disappear.
Damn it.
What a coward.
He needs to attack us already!
But that also means that he's cautious.
it's probably only when they're certain they're going to win.
Oh?
Hey, that's Koichi.
Why's he trying to act all cool, drinking tea?
Hey, Ko—
What?!
A... A girl?!
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 1
Koichi, was me asking you to come here, um...
a bother?
Huh? No, it's not a bother...
But I was wondering what you needed.
Wow, so Koichi's with a girl...
That chick's in my class! Her name is Yukako Yamagishi.
All right! Let's get a bit closer!
If it's money, I can probably manage about 1,000 yen...
Or did you want me to switch weekly duties with you?
That's not what this is about.
Huh? It's not? Then what is it?
we've already got a dumb dog named Police at home.
Koichi!
I'm just going to come out and say it.
Koichi...
I'm in love with you, Koichi.
Huh?
What?!
U-Um... Uh, um... Wh-What?!
You're the only thing I think about all day, Koichi.
I've been so afraid to express these feelings...
But if I don't, I feel like my chest is going to burst.
I don't mind if you hate me.
Wh-What is going on? Did someone just confess her love to me?!
To me?!
I can't believe it, but she did just say that, right?
I-I'm so happy...
Why is it Koichi? You can't be serious! Come on!
Even I've never had anyone tell me that!
You don't have to cry about it.
But seriously? I'm surprised, Koichi...
I'm sure that you must have a girlfriend, Koichi...
Huh? I-I don't...
But, um... Are you making fun of me?
I'm serious!
Koichi, your face has gotten sharper lately.
You look like a man with courage and conviction.
But you're also so cute when you smile.
Yeah, she's definitely got a point.
My face is pretty sharp too, isn't it?
I think the best thing about a man is his future.
And Koichi, your future is shining.
Wh-When you speak that highly of me...
I'm sure you must hate girls like me that aren't cute.
Huh? Not cute? That's not true...
Damn it, she cute!
Just say yes already!
Do you hate me?
Huh? Uh, n-no, I don't, but...
Then do you love me?
Huh? Wait a sec... It's just that, um...
So you do hate me...
Huh? That's not it!
Which is it?! Do you love me or don't you?!
Just answer me already! I've already told you so much!
I spilled my coffee! This is all your fault!
Um... I just got all worked up... I-I'm sorry. I'm just...
By the way, you will come see me again, right?
Y-You know... I feel like a balloon that's been deflated.
All my jealousy just flew away somewhere.
Y-Yeah...
Let's just pretend we never saw anything.
What's wrong with this cola?!
Th-Th-There's so much... in it!
Stand users are drawn to one another...
Nah, it couldn't be.
Chemistry Lab
It's me, Koichi.
Y-Yukako!
What are you doing?
Um, as you can see, it's my turn to clean the lab.
Fourth period was chemistry lab.
Ah...
Koichi...
I said some weird things yesterday.
Would you just forget all that?
I get that way when I think too hard. It's so embarrassing.
People are supposed to be more broad-minded.
Uh, r-right...
It was a little surprising, b-but I didn't think anything of it...
Will you still be friends with me?
O-Of course! I would be honored, yes!
Thank goodness.
That's a bit dramatic.
And to make it up to you... Here.
I was up until this morning knitting this for you, Koichi.
Thank goodness! It's a perfect fit!
I knew your height and chest size, but I was worried how it would fit your shoulders.
Charm
I made you a good luck charm, too...
In hopes that you'll find a wonderful love.
I also prepared lunch so we could eat it together...
I bought this shrimp at the fish market this morning.
You can't find this freshness at a store.
See this flounder meuniere?
Here. Say, "Ah."
Ahh...
There's one thing I know now...
Yukako Yamagishi, to be completely honest, is extremely strange!
Ahh...
I have to hurry up and turn her down!
But if I refuse it, she'll probably get mad.
What should I do?!
Hirose!
Why are you wasting time?
You need to hurry up and throw this garbage away before class starts.
I-I'm saved!
R-Right! Right!
I-I'd better go throw it away.
Ugh, you're useless.
Here, give me that.
I'll hold half of it for you.
Huh? N-No, I'd feel bad...
Just give it to me!
I'm the class rep, so I'm the one who'll get yelled at.
S-Sorry...
Hey, you.
Would you stop bothering Koichi?
Koichi? You mean Koichi Hirose?
I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
I know what you're doing.
Homewrecker?! What are you talking about?
I'll make sure you regret it.
Just one second.
I tried to be classy about this, but...
Koichi Hirose?
I couldn't care less about him!
You have no right to tell me what the hell I can or can't do!
Dumbass!
Ow!
What was that?
What the hell is her problem?!
She's not right in the head. She actually likes Hirose?
Hmph. Hilarious. I'll tell the whole school!
Huh?
What is that?
Something's hot... Something's wrong.
It's insanely hot...
W-Water!
S-Someone! I need w-wa...
Hey, Josuke...
Looks like Yukako Yamagishi really was a Stand user.
Her Stand has hair that moves.
Yeah. But it doesn't seem like she's an enemy, or going to attack Koichi.
By the way, Okuyasu, what are you gonna do about her hair?
I can't fix something after your The Hand takes it away.
She can't complain. I saved her from getting burnt to a crisp.
Sorry, but I'm not a beautician.

Year 1 English Exam Answer Sheet
Quiz 2 Koichi Hirose
This is my English test from earlier.
I'm worrying so much about Yukako, I can't concentrate on anything else.
Even I did better! I only got 32 points, though.
To be honest, I was a little happy at first.
I'd never had a girl tell me she loved me before.
I get that. I totally get that! So much it hurts!
But I'm the one who let it come to this by not being up-front with her.
I'm thinking about telling her straight
that I don't like her or anything, so she needs to leave me alone.
That's not a good idea, Koichi.
If you say that, you're only going to add fuel to the flames of Yukako's passion.
You'll piss her off.
Y-You think so?
Of course! Listen.
Right now, we have to figure out how to make her not hate you.
But how?
everything will be happily ever after, right?
Y-Yeah...
So you've just got to act that way on purpose in front of her.
Yeah, that totally makes sense!
You're so smart, Josuke.
Thanks!
But hearing that from you doesn't make me feel better.
I wonder what I need to do to make Yukako think I'm terrible.
Well, most girls aren't into bad hygiene or mama's boys.
I-I don't want her to think I'm a mama's boy!
She might get mad at my mom and put her in danger!
Then it's bad hygiene for you!
Starting today, no more baths.
Huh?!
Yeah, and don't brush your teeth or change your underwear.
How about getting some lice or spiders in your hair?
Having smelly socks is pretty bad.
Maybe you should fart everywhere.
Yeah, she'll totally hate that!
Stop messing around! I'm serious about this!
I'm being serious, too!
What?!
If you don't want to do that, then you need to become a guy
You need to make her give up on you.
We'll help you out. All right?
Okay...
What? Koichi Hirose did that? Unbelievable!
He was really shoplifting? That's awful.
Yeah! Koichi said so himself.
He was talking about it like he was proud of it.
You know what else? Koichi never keeps his promises.
I lent him money, and he never paid me back.
He cheats on his tests and steals girls' underwear.
He's got no future. He's gonna bring about his own downfall.
I'm gonna stop hanging out with him.
I'll cut ties with him, too.
Man, that girl is intense.
she'll give up.
Josuke, Okuyasu...
I hope they did a good job with all that stuff.
I hope she actually gives up on me.
What is that?
My eyes are closed... Is this a dream?
A woman?
I-It's Yukako!
I can't believe this. She's even showing up in my dreams...
I can't rest at all!
It appears that your friends don't think too highly of you, Koichi.
But don't worry. You have me.
I'll properly discipline you and make you into a fine man.
You have something that other men don't.
You must live up to that potential.
J-Josuke! This totally backfired!
Where am I?
Koichi, are you hungry?
Breakfast will be ready shortly.
O-Okay...
She has that hair Stand...
I'm going to have to wait for a chance to run.
That's my only hope!
Th-There's something I want to ask you.
Yes?
Your hair last night... Wh-What was that?
Did that startle you?
Of course. I guess anyone who suddenly saw that would be.
someone shot an arrow through my chest.
No, that might have been a dream.
When I woke up, my wound was healed, and I was able to do that...
Keicho Nijimura!
D-Do you know anyone else who can do anything like that?
No.
She hasn't realized that I'm a Stand user!
Now, have a seat. You're a growing boy.
you can't become a fine man for me.
I-I just need to play along with her for now.
Wow, this looks delicious! I'm digging in!
You're not eating just yet, Koichi.
English Exam Answer Sheet
Koichi Hirose
You got a 16 on your English exam.
Even if a man is more than just his brains, this is just awful.
I've decided to have you study while you eat.
Understand?
I'm going to give you some questions.
W-Wait a sec...
You're going to do this!
Right?
Here's your question.
Prince often sings the lyric "funky music." What does that mean in Japanese?
Wild Music
A: Wild music.
B: Primitive music.
Primitive Music
C: Fantasy music.
Fantasy Music
I-If I disobey, I'll be in trouble...
I have a feeling it's A, but B and C also sound right.
Whatever, I'll just pick one.
I think it's B...
Squee! You're right!
I'm so happy! This box contains boiled eggs!
I'll peel them for you. You want some salt, right?
By the way, if you had chosen box A, I would have had you eat this eraser.
Wild Music
Huh?!
Box C contained soap.
Wh-What?!
Next, you'll be able to eat bacon and eggs. Do your best.
Question: How is "contrast" () written in Japanese?
Is it C?
Taisho
Taisho
Taisho
Sh-She's serious...
If I choose the wrong box, she'll definitely make me eat what's in there...
Come on, hurry up and answer!
The food will get cold.
U-Um, uh...
What am I going to do? This is ridiculous...
I-I think it's C...
Koichi, you just chose your answer by watching the look on my face, didn't you?
Huh?!
So the rumors about you being someone
As punishment, I'll have you eat both A and B.
A is English vocabulary corn flakes.
B is asparagus wrapped in pages from an English dictionary.
I'm going to make sure you learn while you eat!
Here!
Open your mouth! I'll feed it to you.
What's the matter? Eat!
No way! You expect me to put up with this?! I can't take it anymore!
I'm outta here!
I-I'm being pulled! By my scalp!
Th-There's moving hair mixed in!
That's right. I had planted a few hundred strands of my hair in your scalp.
you may come to hate me.
and I know you'll thank me.
You'll realize that you need a woman like me in your life.
You won't be able to live without Yukako Yamagishi.
you won't be getting the next dish.
This is some company president's holiday villa.
S-Summer?!
it doesn't matter if anyone comes...
Because love is invincible.
H-Help me!
Episode 9 Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 2
Episode 9 , Part 2
Hey, apparently Koichi's family doesn't know, either.
They were talking about possibly calling the police.
So he is missing. And since Yukako isn't here, either...
I sort of feel responsible.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Nah, I doubt she's gone that far yet.
We need to find him, and fast.
This might end up being a life or death situation.
It won't open!
This is awful!
Q. What year did Columbus discover the new continent? The answer is the lock's combination.
It was also a movie title, wasn't it?
But it looked really long, so I didn't watch it.
I've almost got it...

Um...
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 2
I washed your underwear and your pajama pants for you.
What's wrong?
I won't know if you don't say anything.
I-I'm a first-year in high school...
This goes beyond being embarrassed. I feel like an awful human being.
Please, stop this already.
You hate me now, don't you?
You think I'm pathetic, don't you?
Just let me go home already.
What could you possibly like about me, after I peed my pants?
Oh, you poor thing, Koichi.
I must be tormenting your heart.
I'm a bad girl.
Nothing I say does any good!
I-I can feel tears starting to well up...
First I wet my pants, and now I'm getting wet with tears?
But Koichi...
I can see something shining, something invigorating, deep in your eyes.
Like you still have a trump card hidden up your sleeve.
That's what I like about you.
I would love to see what that is.
It's strange that you'd even worry.
I felt true bliss while I was washing your pants.
Look!
I'm working on a chair that has electricity running through it.
I'll make sure it's done by dinner study time.
I'm thinking about making Italian for dinner.
I should go buy some olive oil.
Look forward to it.
H-Help me!
She's just getting worse!
o-or she's seriously going to kill me!
But...
How am I going to escape?
Koichi's got Reverb, though.
With that thing, he can still call for help even if he's being gagged, right?
But Reverb's range is about 50 meters.
He might've been taken to a place where no one else lives nearby.
There are tons of places like that.
Wait!
She said she was going to buy some olive oil.
But I can't imagine her going out shopping in this situation.
Is she going to order by phone, then?
Could it be...
There it is! A pay phone!
48 meters! Yes!
It's just within my range!
Reverb is a sound Stand!
Now I can signal Josuke for help.
I don't have any 10 yen coins!
I was wearing pajamas when I was brought here.
Should I dial 110?
But that woman might actually kill the police.
I'm just going to have to contact Josuke somehow!
You were wondering if there was a pay phone nearby, weren't you?
Y-Yukako...
I know exactly what you're thinking.
But even if you were to get to it, you don't have any 10 yen coins.
That's what you were thinking, right?
I-Is there a pay phone?
Hmph. Playing dumb, I see.
You should abandon the idea of trying to call someone.
You wont be able to set foot outside of this house.
Just in case, I'm going to go destroy the 110 button on the phone.
Is there anything that you'd like?
N-No, not really...
Wh-What is wrong with her?!
I guess it's no use... I can't contact anyone...
Beep Boop Beep Boop Beep
What are these letters?
There's suddenly sound coming from my hand...
It's calling somewhere!
I haven't even dialed the phone number yet.
Hello? This is Higashikata.
It connected!
As long as the call sounds go through, calls on those phones will be connected.
Hello, is this Koichi? Hey! It's me, Josuke!
Koichi, where are you?
What? I can hear the sound of waves...
Koichi, you...
You have a power like I do, don't you?
Yes! Now Josuke will definitely come here!
It'll only take 15 to 20 minutes by car.
I just have to survive until then!
N-No matter what!
The sound of waves... A pay phone...
The place Koichi is...
It's gotta be here!
Koichi.
Koichi!
She's coming back!
Open the door, Koichi.
Wh-Why don't you just break the door down?
If Josuke sees a broken door, he'll definitely think something's wrong.
I'm very happy right now.
I'm so happy that you have powers like I do, Koichi.
Though it pisses me off that you were hiding that from me.
But I'm still very happy.
Because the most important thing for a man and a woman living together
is love, and having the same goals and values, right?
We have something in common that no one else has.
We have the ultimate compatibility.
So please, Koichi...
Open the door.
I told you to open the door. Hurry up and open the door!
I hate you
I hate you
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
Th-The ultimate compatibility?!
That sound won't go away until you cry, apologize, and give up on me.
What is this? I don't hear any of this.
I hate you—
Huh?!
Th-This is...
nothing like that time with Tamami.
Her delusions are way too strong!
I had no idea sh-she'd be this stubborn...
I finally found out that we've been bound by the one
Some people never find it at all.
Don't you understand how wonderful that is?
Koichi...
but now things are different.
I won't let you leave this house until you fall in love with me.
I will make you love me!
Or else...
I might just kill you.
I can't let her in here, no matter what...
I need to attack her with Reverb one more time!
If I try harder, I'll be able to produce a louder sound than before.
Reverb!
Something's wrong with Reverb...
Reverb!
It's not moving!
D-Did it die?
Did my Stand die of utter despair?
Reverb is dead!
Re
Rev
Rever
Reverb
Ko
Koichi
Koichi Hiro
Koichi Hirose
N-No! M-My...
My Reverb isn't moving at all!
Stands use mental ability to move.
I pushed it too far, and then it got too worked up and died!
My Reverb...
What?!
Wh-What is that?
It's called a "Stand"?
What is that Stand?
This shoe cabinet is in my way!
I-I'm going to be killed!
If she comes in the door and catches me, then sooner or later, I'll be killed!
Open up, Koichi!
Don't come through that door!
If only that door would blow her far away...
It's gone! It's just an empty shell.
Where did you put it?
Huh?
I'm asking what happened to the thing inside that!
Huh?!
Th...
That's...
Wh-What is this? My Reverb
i-isn't dead!
Did it emerge from its old shell into a new form?
What is this?
The design's only changed a little, and it shrank.
Just changing its shape won't make any difference!
I-It's fast!
Wh-What is
this wind?!
Bam
Sh-She got blown away!
I'm not sure how, but she just got blown away by something like wind!
Wh-What just...
happened to me?
Reverb's letters are on the door...
Fwoosh
Fwoosh
Because she touched the door with these words on it, they became real.
Fwoosh
The sensation of "Fwoosh" actually blew her away.
Earlier, I wished this door would blow her away...
I guess I was unknowingly controlling it.
This is the new Reverb!
Reverb Act 2!
Koichi...
Teioh
It's those two...
But there are, like, dozens of villas around here.
We can't tell which one it is.
We have to find the pay phone! Koichi called us from one.
Let's find the pay phone first and then look at the houses near it.
Yeah.
Cute little Koichi belongs to me.
I won't let anyone else have him.
You probably shouldn't come any closer, Yukako.
I can tell for myself
You won't be able to keep me here.
My left eyelid is starting to twitch.
Ever since I was little, my orbicularis oculi muscle would
and I'd start to feel a bit violent.
Don't you get up on your high horse just because
I'm going to have to get violent now!
Hot!
H-How dare you?!
My hand got burnt! You little shit!
How dare you do this to me?!
You belong to me!
You belong to me, but you dare defy me?!
Even though you belong to me?!
Reverb Act 2!
I missed?
Hey, Josuke.
I heard it.
Hey, I think it's that house.
T-To think that her hair would grow this much...
Mental ability that's completely black and vindictive...
Was yours called Reverb?
Now that I know what it does, it's not impressive at all.
I just need to make sure I don't touch those letters, right?
By the way, I'll ask you one more time...
You love me, right?
Just try to say that you don't love me.
I'll rip you and this house apart right here, right now.
because you'll live on in my heart as a memory forever.
Hurry up and answer me!
I'm in this mess right now because
I've been telling you that I don't like you
all this time.
I'll kill you, Koichi!
Dogon
I've also already told you
that you won't be able to catch me.
You've touched the letters that will blow you away.
Those letters are on me, the one you called a little shit.
Her hair turned white!
She's not dead, is she?
She's alive!
I suppose I should be happy about this.
I wasn't able to catch you...
But I figured out that all I need to do is destroy your Stand!
Impudent brat!
Dumbass!
I-I can't believe you can still attack...
Your mental ability is insane!
Shut up!
How dare you, you little pissy-pants?!
How dare you do this to me?!
you limp-dicked bastard!
I loved you!
But I can't forgive you for doing this to my beautiful hair!
I don't care who you are! I won't forgive you if you harm my beauty!
I'm gonna rip off this pissy-pants' little dick and pull out his organs along with it!
S-Stop...
Shut up!
What? What was that noise just now?
Let go of my Reverb and grab hold of something.
Hah! Don't make up shit just because you think it'll save you!
I have to let go of this thing and grab on to something!
Damn it!
I-I don't have... time!
Boingy-Boing
Boingy-Boing
It crumbled, just like I said, right?
But you don't understand anything I say, do you?
You mean you had written it there already?
When I was trying to rip Reverb apart...
You put those letters on that rock beneath the cliff?
he was already trying to think of how to save me?
I-I've lost completely.
No, I lost the moment I first saw Koichi.
Hey, Koichi! Are you alive?
Are you all right, Koichi?!
Josuke! Okuyasu!
Took you long enough to get here! Jeez!
B-But I love him even more now.
I don't care if he completely ignores me.
I'm happy just thinking
about you, Koichi!
Hey, look over there! Is that Yukako?
Her hair's gone completely white!
Whoa, you're right.
But isn't that chick smiling like she couldn't be any happier?
And she's looking right this way.
Huh?!
You're right. That's creepy as hell.
Let's get outta here!
Save me, Josuke!
Don't depend on me!
Well, I'll be damned. Did you see that, Masaji?
I ain't drunk, Gramps!
Directions: Ask one of the local fishermen, "Where's Cape Boingy-Boing?" They will kindly take you there by boat.
Boingy-Boing Cape.
It seems it grew famous due to a rumor
only for a rock in the cape to go "boingy-boing" and gently fling her back.
Hirose!
You worked really hard on this exam.
You can do it if you try.

Episode 10 Let's Go Eat Some Italian Food
Episode 10 Food
Man, I'm hungry.
After we visit Big Bro's grave, let's get something to eat, Josuke.
I'm not hungry.
Italian Cuisine Trendy 100 Meters to the Left
There's a new Italian restaurant. Apparently it's just ahead.
Just ahead is the cemetery.
Josuke, I think that might actually be what brings people in.
The flavor must be like, "Oh, man! I can't stop drooling!"
Let's go! Let's go!
Is this it?
Trendy
I thought this was an empty building...
Maybe they remodeled it. It looks nice.
What? "Depends on the customer"?
Today's Course Depends on the Customer With Coffee & Dessert From 3,500 yen
The inside looks nice, too!
Welcome.
 Let's Go Eat Some Italian Food
Two of you?
Come, have a seat.
Uh... Thanks...
Please.
R-Right...
Um, are you a foreigner?
Si, Signore. I'm Italian.
My name is Tonio Trendy. Please call me Tonio.
Well, this is great! We get to eat authentic Italian food!
I have traveled the world.
I've studied various cuisines to better the cuisine of my motherland.
Then I came to Japan hoping to get my chance.
Morioh is a wonderful place.
I love it very much.
Nice! I wonder what I should get.
Menu?
We don't have a menu here.
What do you mean you don't have a menu?
Because what I serve depends on the customer.
So show me the menu.
No, no! It means that I will determine the dishes by looking at the customers.
What the hell?
You had diarrhea last night, didn't you?
No wonder your eyes are so puffy.
Let me see your left hand, too.
H-How do you know all that?!
By looking at both of your hands, I know everything about your health.
Oh, I'm sorry!
What about you, signore?
Yeah, I'm not really hungry, so just coffee is fine.
I'll have a cappuccino.
Ho capito.
Healthy food that concentrates too much on being healthy
If it tastes even a little bad, we don't have to pay.
Right.
J-Josuke...
This water... No, is this mineral water?
What's up?
I-I've never had water this delicious before!
It's like... water filled with elegance...
It's so soothing.
Like the first water you drink after wandering in the desert for three days.
Y-You're right! This is great!
So good!
Whew
You're right. This is delicious.
Th-This water is so delicious that I'm about to cry.
Hey, you don't have to cry just from drinking some water.
Maybe it's because it's so pure.
The tears just keep flowing! It won't stop!
O-Okuyasu! Hey, there's something wrong with you.
Gush
O-Okuyasu!
Wh-What the hell's with these tears?!
Okuyasu, y-your eyes, your eyeballs, the white part...
It's all shriveled up and squishy!
Momento! Please do not panic.
Y-You bastard! What did you make Okuyasu drink?
Please, calm down! His eyeballs will only be shriveled up momentarily.
That mineral water is from snow on Kilimanjaro in Africa
The reason you didn't start crying when you drank it
Josuke!
I'm not sleepy at all now!
Seriously? O-Okuyasu, are you sure there's nothing wrong with your eyes?
trust me, you're bound to cry.
I cried even more when I watched the movie on video.
Really?
Yeah!
Here's your cappuccino.
R-Right...
Now, shall we continue with the meal?
Hey, that looks really good.
• 1 Anchovy • Seaweed • Olive oil • White wine vinegar • Lemon juice • Salt • Pepper • Etc. • Balsamic vinegar (just a splash) • Toast • Lettuce (for garnish) (Best eaten within 15 minutes of preparation)
For the antipasto, we have a salad with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.
M-M-Mozzaza?
Mozzarella cheese is a soft, fresh cheese whose fat has been taken out.
Everyone in Italy loves to eat it.
The first people to use tomatoes in cooking were the Italians.
This is not bragging. It's merely pride.
Please, help yourselves.
Heck, yeah!
Yeah, that's pretty good.
It's good. Pretty good.
But... I'm not sure what it is, but this cheese doesn't have much flavor.
No! No!
You need to put it in your mouth with the tomato.
What? the tomato?
So good!
Huh?!
The juicy part of the tomatoes wraps around the mild cheese!
The cheese brings out the tomato, and the tomato brings out the cheese!
It's like harmony, or like a harmony of tastes!
It's kind of like a Simon and Garfunkel duet!
The that Tetsuya Chiba drew
Grazie! I couldn't be happier that you enjoyed it.
H-Hey, Okuyasu. Let me try a little.
No way.
You should just order some yourself!
I wouldn't give you any even if you were about to die of hunger.
It's so good! I'm so glad I was born, Mom!
Damn it! I knew you were cheap, but I didn't know it was this bad!
Fine. I'll order a plate myself.
Ho capito.
However, the only one who will have his stiff shoulder cured is the
Huh? Stiff shoulder?
C-Come to think of it, my neck feels a bit hot.
Sir, I recommend that you take off your jacket.
S-Suddenly...
I-I-I'm getting really itchy!
S-Something slimy is stuck to my fingers!
That would be dead skin.
Dead skin?!
It's proof that your metabolism has improved and blood is circulating well.
The calcium, vitamins, and minerals in the antipasto that you just ate
have stimulated the thyroid gland in your throat that controls your metabolism.
All of your bad cells are coming out as dead skin.
Okuyasu, stop scratching! It's as big as a softball now!
You're starting to dig at the muscle in your shoulder!
N-No! You're wrong, Josuke!
It's light!
My shoulder feels so stupidly light!
Look! My shoulder's so much more flexible!
My shoulder isn't stiff anymore!
Now, if you'll excuse me for a bit.
Holy crap! That Chef Tonio guy is a genius!
N-No...
Morioh Landmark 3 How to get there: 1 minute on foot after getting off the bus headed towardMorioh's Kunimi Mountain Pass Cemetery An unusual restaurant with no set menu. The chef will decide the menu based on how the customer is feeling that day. Because seating is limited, it is recommended that you make a reservation.
Now, let's continue with the meal, shall we?
Next is the primo piatto.
I call it... harlot spaghetti!
 • Spaghetti • Pitted black olives • Olive oil • Anchovies • Garlic • Red peppers • Cherry tomatoes •Misc: Parsley, salt, pepper, etc •Parmesan cheese (Best eaten while still hot)
Apparently the name of this dish came from
Are there red peppers in this spaghetti?
Yes, there are.
Rome
Naples
The harlot's spaghetti uses a pasta sauce that is one of the oldest in Italian cuisine.
Spaghetti
Tagliatelle
Linguine
Fusilli
Penne
Farfalle
It was born in my hometown of Naples.
Lasagna
Conchiglie
Tubetti
That is why I recommend this dish.
Oh, well... I can't eat spicy things.
I can't even eat curry rice unless it's
I can't! It's super spicy!
This is way too spicy!
then don't eat it.
If you can't eat it, don't worry.
I'm perfectly fine with not charging for that pasta.
I will go make the secondo piatto, the main dish.
However, my spaghetti is made such that even people who
Even if I don't like spicy things?
Hot!
I totally admit that you're a talented chef, Tonio!
That guy's definitely a genius!
But this was a miss.
No, maybe you were lucky that you couldn't eat it.
Don't you think this food and that water are way too weird?
Suspicious? What is?
So hot!
You lost a softball's worth of dead skin, and you cried your eyes out!
You think so?
I lost even more dead skin, and my back pain went away!
That much is totally normal.
Hot!
Listen! I just remembered what that Toshikazu Hazamada said.
Stand users, for some reason, seem to be unknowingly...
Stand users are drawn to each other!
Josuke!
Are you saying that Tonio is a Stand user, too?
Shh! We don't know yet! That's why I'm saying he's suspicious!
Suspicious, eh?
Hot! I can't eat this!
If you can't eat spicy food, stop licking it!
Th-That's right. I can't eat spicy food, but you know...
I just want to keep licking this spaghetti sauce.
Why are you eating it?!
I-I know! I shouldn't be able to eat something this spicy...
But...
you've eaten a whole bag!
Hey, I told you to stop eating that!
M-My stomach's opening up!
It's so good!
Okuyasu, you idiot!
Your tooth! Your tooth just flew out!
That's my cavity! My rotten tooth fell out!
C-Come to think of it, I had a cavity on my lower jaw, too...
That's a cavity, too!
Your tooth! A molar is growing in at that speed?!
This settles it. I don't know what he's plotting, but...
Shining Diamond!
But I wanted to eat more...
I'm going to revert that spaghetti back to its original ingredients!
What were those little things just now?
A Stand!
Tonio Trendy was a Stand user after all!
Are you all right, Okuyasu?
My sleepiness is gone.
My shoulder stiffness disappeared, and new teeth replaced my cavities, but...
M-My stomach hurts! My stomach's hurting so bad!
Wait there!
Tonio! Just what are you plotting?!
Where is he?
So the main course is finished...
Good, good... You're eating that right up.
What?!
What are you doing there?
You saw, didn't you?!
So you came in here to spy on me?!
You will pay for this! Prepare yourself!
Why do I have to listen to you threatening to make pay?
That's my line!
Okuyasu!
Why are you eating?!
I can't help it! My stomach hurts, but I can't help eating it!
Every time the tanginess of the apple sauce
To think a flavor like this existed in this world!
Don't eat that meat, Okuyasu!
I'm so happy! It's like happiness over and over!
It's so good!
M-My innards...
My stomach!
Okuyasu!
You'll pay for this!
You bastard!
Wash your hands with soap right now!
Medicinal
Huh?!
It's unforgivable!
Entering the kitchen without permission is unforgivable!
You! The kitchen must stay clean!
S-Soap? Are you telling me to wash my hands?
Hey, Josuke!
My guts suddenly feel way better! I feel really full, too.
I feel totally satisfied.
Huh?!
My diarrhea tummy's all better!
What?!
Good for you.
The puppy...
This dish was a little iffy, so I was having him taste it first.
His tummy was a little upset, too.
Y-You... seriously only wanted to feed Okuyasu good food?
What else could a chef ask for?
That is what I live for. That is all I hope for.
You're a Stand user, aren't you?
We are, too.
Oh, I cannot believe it!
When... When I went around the world
This is the first time I've met anyone else with similar powers.
But you! You lack common sense!
Huh?
You touched things without washing your hands, didn't you?!
The number one enemy in a kitchen is germs!
That's why I got angry!
H-Huh? I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!
You'd better prepare yourself!
Now, let us continue with the cooking.
Dessert is... flan?
But I'm a street punk!
Hmph! Me eating flan is laughable.
So good!
You really are a genius!
I'm so proud to live in Morioh, where a chef like you lives!
Damn you, Okuyasu!
It appears that he's pleased.
You! Your hands aren't moving!
This is so pathetic...
Hey, my athlete's foot is all better!
Please come again. Grazie!

"I should be arriving at Morioh's port tomorrow at noon.
From Joseph Joestar."
Episode 11 Chili Pepper, Part 1
Episode 11 Pepper, Part 1
Josuke, how long are you going to be playing that?
I'm gonna shut it off myself.
Just five more minutes! Please!
Just let me play for five more minutes!
This is the most exciting part!
and I'll regret it the rest of my life!
Do you really want your son to end up like that, Mom?!
the kicks are just going to get harder!
How long can you put up with this?
I-It's over...
D'oh.
Now, put that away and do your homework.
And take off your damn uniform when you're at home.
I won't be able to see you anymore.
Why, Sachiko? Don't you love me?
Weird. I thought I turned it off.
That's not it. I'm thinking about leaving town.
And you want to forget about me?
Huh? It won't turn off.
Looks like Jotaro Kujo's not leaving town...
Even though I warned him all those times.
Well, what's the deal, Josuke Higashikata?
You're...
Chili Pepper?!
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Chili Pepper, Part 1
Why'd you come here?
Don't ask that now.
I've been stopping by here every now and then for a while now.
What?
So this bastard's been watching me for a long time?
And I know that Toshikazu Hazamada
Kick your ass?
I'm here to kill you painlessly.
good sir.
I told Jotaro this before, but Jotaro's Star Platinum is a menace to me.
It's the fact that Jotaro is too attentive
So I just wanted to see just how much stronger my Stand has gotten over time.
Come a bit closer.
Closer! Until you can attack as quickly and precisely as Star Platinum, Josuke!
Come on! If you're that far away, your punches will be too weak.
Are you mocking me?
Of course not.
Come closer and give me a super sharp one.
Here. Hit me right here. Come on. Come closer!
Crack!
Huh? H-He's fast...
Quit your daydreaming!
Much faster than I thought!
maybe I'll just help you sleep!
Listen up! Jotaro's Star Platinum is nothing like this!
I regret my actions.
What?!
Josuke! What the hell is all that noise?
What was that Stand power? It felt like a jet engine going off...
He might just be stronger than Jotaro...
You, too, Josuke.
Looks like I'm not the only one that's grown.
I'll wait a little longer.
Until my Chili Pepper grows stronger, I won't be able to defeat Jotaro.
He can show up anywhere there's electricity.
Not only does he have tremendous power, but he can control his Stand remotely.
Josuke, I just asked you what all that noise was!
It's nothing.
Man, a bug totally just bit me.
Damn it! Bugs only come to me.
Ah, Josuke!
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.
What did you want to talk about, Josuke?
Why call us out to a lonely-looking place like this?
Couldn't we go to Tonio's or the usual café?
I'm not the one who called you guys out here. It was Jotaro.
Jotaro did? I wonder what he wants.
It's probably about Chili Pepper.
What?! Chili Pepper?
So he appeared?
Yeah, he did. At my place last night.
You bastard! Why didn't you let me know right away?!
Okuyasu... He acts completely different when it comes to Chili Pepper.
I can't blame him, since that Stand killed his brother, but...
I told Josuke to keep quiet.
Talking about him in the city, where there's electricity running, is dangerous.
Jotaro!
I had you all come to this field so he wouldn't hear us talking.
Okuyasu, Chili Pepper totally pisses me off, too.
He got into my house without me knowing.
He's free to listen to us talking and take whatever he wants.
Come to think of it, the homework I finished
And I thought my mom mistook it for trash—
That's not a big deal, Koichi!
What I'm trying to say is that the only reason
and he drags people who piss him off into the phone lines
with about as much effort as someone making a pervy phone call.
I saw first-hand that he's gotten stronger.
We have to hurry up and find out who his user is.
B-But how?
We all gathered here to figure that out, right, Jotaro?
No, not quite.
We'll be able to find him.
Because the person who's capable
Huh?
Someone who can find him?
Is he a Stand user?!
That's right.
His Stand's name is Hermit Purple.
Only he's gotten way too old, so he doesn't have the strength to fight.
Too old? How old is this guy?
Yeah. I know him very well.
though you wouldn't guess that now.
He's 80... No, maybe he's 79...
79?! He's super old!
Well, his legs are weak, so he's using a cane.
He wears full dentures
He's also starting to forget things.
Hey, come on, now.
Give me a break!
I had you guys gather here in order to protect that old man.
If Chili Pepper finds out about him, he's probably going to kill him.
Because the thing Chili Pepper fears most is us finding out who his user is.
Yeah, but is a geezer like that really going to be useful to us?
Came to Japan? Is he a foreigner, Jotaro?
Yeah.
Josuke, th-this is serious!
Huh? What is?
Josuke! If he's 79, a foreigner, and a Stand user...
Y-You can't mean...
I heard you loud and clear.
Chili Pepper!
Impossible! How'd he get to this field?
Morioh Landmark #4 How to get there: From bus stop #1, take the bus for "Morioh Grand Swimming Area" and get off at the "Morioh Grand Hotel" stop. From there, it's a 0-minute walk. Located in the same area as many expensive villas, it's an elegant hotel full of history. It has housed various travelers to Morioh and has been beloved for years. The beef tongue served at the hotel restaurant is considered superb and is the talk of the town.
Rumble
Why?! There aren't any electrical lines here, so how?!
The bike's battery.
Shit! He must have hidden in the bike's battery and followed us here.
In my bike?
He heard us!
The port at noon?
An old geezer Stand user who can find me?
Rumble
I'll be sure to kill that geezer the moment he arrives at the port!
Now he knows about the old man...
In other words, Josuke's father.
Rumble
This isn't good.
If we let him go, he's gonna get to the old man before we do.
Josuke! We need to throw a rock at that bike and destroy it!
No, hold up.
will kill that bastard!
He cut through space-time!
Ack! Keicho's younger brother!
I'm the one who's going to deal with you.
I'll scrape you away!
at least in regards to you instantly transferring over here.
But the scratching motion you do with your The Hand
seems to stand no chance against Chili Pepper's swiftness.
You're too slow!
Take a better look, you dumbass.
I meant the bike.
The bike's front wheel!
Now you won't be able to run away.
You actually used your head, Okuyasu. Good job!
Chili Pepper can't go far from the bike's battery.
Which means... Look!
so you're as good as caught!
That was close!
No, we haven't actually caught him yet.
The bike battery is still there.
I'm sure he plans to do whatever he can to kill Okuyasu and run.
We're going, too!
Right!
Right!
Do you really think you've trapped me?
Are you trying to get revenge for Keicho?
No.
My Big Bro
deserved to die.
I knew that someone would kill him someday.
The thing about crimes...
somewhere, somehow, it's going to come back and get you.
Even I can figure that out.
If you tell me
I'll spare your life.
If I tell you, you'll spare my life?
You're calmer than I thought.
I thought your insides were boiling from wanting revenge so badly.
Deep down inside, I hope you don't tell me!
I'm dying to scrape you away so bad, you dumbass!
I knew it.
But you want to scrape me away?
With that pathetically slow right hand?
Should I laugh, or should I yawn?
It's a tough choice!
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
I'll make sure you know well
just how slow your Stand is!
Do you see now? It's this slow!
Okuyasu!
Okuyasu!
Shit!
Here comes Jotaro...
I can't stick around here for long.
What?! He's behind me?!
so I could instantly transfer.
Did you forget?
I've got you now!
You little shit!
Looks like you're getting quite a bit slower.
Are you going to be able to escape the next attack?
Look! Chili Pepper's electrical sparkle is fading!
He's getting weaker!
His Stand's power must be running out!
Does this mean Okuyasu wins?
Okuyasu! Don't finish him off yet!
Wait until we get there.
You've won!
You're right... I'm weakening.
Your Stand's right hand is slow as hell, but it's still a terrifying Stand.
But...
Are you sure you don't want to finish me off?
Maybe I'm just acting like I've grown weak, Okuyasu.
What?!
Maybe I'm waiting for Jotaro to get closer so I can chop his head off.
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, nothing.
or wait for Jotaro to get here?
You bastard...
But wait. Why would you tell me that?
You're telling me to finish you off?! Do you want to die?
I'll leave that up to you.
Is he really weaker?
Which is the truth?
Are you coming or aren't you?
If he's fine, I need to go in to finish him.
It's possible he's got something up his sleeve, too.
Should I?
Okuyasu... Something's wrong.
Hurry up and make up your mind, Okuyasu.
Damn it!
I can't be bothered to think about which is right anymore, damn it!
Okuyasu!
Don't try and stop me, Jotaro!
He killed my big bro! I'm going to finish this!
That's the only truth inside my heart!
Die, you little shit!
Gaon
Just great. Now finding the bow and arrow is going to be a real pain.
Though it looks like things were settled.
No, something is wrong.
Huh?!
There were electrical cables underground?
That bastard! He me to dig this up!
I really was weakened.
The bike's battery is only a 12-volt.
That was close!
Why, you...
Thanks to you, I feel alive again!
Okuyasu!
If you had only been a good little boy
Wha...
I know where all of the electrical lines in this city are.
but they were far from the bike.
I didn't have the power to dig up the cables.
You bastard!
He's even more...
is on my side.
Bogo
Okuyasu!
Your big brother Keicho said you held him back.
He was right.
Your mind is underdeveloped.
You never could have gotten revenge, you dumbass!
Bye-bye, Jotaro, Josuke!
Joseph Joestar, was it?
I'll have that geezer share the same fate as the Nijimura Brothers!
I've won!
Okuyasu!
He got dragged in there!
Okuyasu!
Okuyasu!
Good grief.
I can't believe we had him cornered and he still got away.
He's a pretty dangerous Stand.
What?! What are you guys talking about?!
Why are you analyzing the enemy's abilities when Okuyasu just died?!
Oh, right. I guess we should worry about Okuyasu.
Right.
Talk about a silver lining.
Looks like Okuyasu has really good luck.
Okuyasu was really lucky that his right arm was chopped off.
Huh?
Shining Diamond!
When I fix his arm, it means his body will come back.
Damn it!
Yay! Okuyasu is back!
Damn it... I-I...
I totally lost to that bastard.
Damn it! Damn it!
It's not about revenge or winning or losing.
We have to think about protecting Joseph Joestar.
That'll lead to us defeating Chili Pepper.
You have to do that for everyone.
For the place where we live...
Jotaro, this isn't good.
I was taking this lightly.
Yeah. We have to get to the old man's boat before Chili Pepper does.
Let's hurry to the port.
Hey, you two! Aren't you acting a bit too cool?
Okuyasu's in shock!
If we're going to the port, this way is closer.
All right.
Hey, wait!
Surpass my big bro, huh...
You taught me a lesson, Chili Pepper.
Mr. Joestar.
We'll be arriving at Morioh Port any moment now.
Episode 11 Chili Pepper, Part 2
Episode 11 Pepper, Part 2
There it is... The old man's ship.
Right on time.
I-Is Mr. Joseph Joestar the only passenger?
Yeah.
The entire crew is from the Speedwagon Foundation.
but I'm sure he'll do everything possible to get
If he gets there before we do, we lose.
Jotaro!
We've finished checking the boat.
He's not in the battery.
All clear. We can take off.
Josuke, the only ones going to the old man's boat are me and Okuyasu.
Huh?
You and Koichi will stay behind at the harbor.
Stay behind?! Josuke and me?
Why?
Josuke, Chili Pepper's user is hiding somewhere in this harbor, watching us.
so he can confirm the boat's position.
But my guess is that he won't be using a boat.
All he needs is something with a battery that's faster than a motorboat.
Morioh Harbor Lighthouse
Fly? You mean it's actually going to fly through the air?
Yeah.
I'm guessing Chili Pepper is
A remote control model plane?!
That could work!
That's faster than this motorboat.
The controller signal's range won't matter!
So Josuke, if you spot something flying, look for his user here at this harbor.
Koichi's Reverb has a range of 50 meters.
If he makes his move before we do, the old man is finished.
You need to protect your father from on-shore. Got it, Josuke?
Yeah, I get it. We don't have even a second to spare.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Chili Pepper, Part 2
Do your best, Okuyasu.
Thanks, Koichi.
We'll arrive at Morioh Port in about twenty minutes, Mr. Joestar.
I see. Um...
Huh? It's right in front of you.
Ahh...
My father, huh...
Josuke? Is something the matter?
Being told that some guy I've never met is my father is just kinda...
You know...
Well, it's different if his life's in danger.
I won't be able to sleep well unless I do my best to protect him.
Besides, I'm sure my mom will bawl her eyes out if he dies.
Damn it! It must have been Jotaro.
If he had you two stay behind to find my user...
Then he completely saw through my plan to use a remote control plane!
Chili Pepper!
Yeah!
Jotaro Kujo is a smart man.
Yeah, he's the one person I don't want finding me.
This Spitfire remote control plane
On the other hand, a motorboat will take about eight to ten minutes.
Y-You're Chili Pepper's user?
The name's Akira Otoishi, nineteen years old.
Oh, and don't mind the guitar.
like Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, who lives hard and passionately!
So I keep it with me all the time.
In the near future, I'm going to take my guitar
and knock out people around the world!
Oh, yeah.
I never even thought that the user would show himself on his own.
That must mean he's confident that he can kill both me and Josuke!
Yeeees
just like I did with Okuyasu earlier.
Stay back, Koichi.
Here we go, Josuke Higashikata!
One sec.
Huh?
then I'm gonna make some rules, too.
Rules? Don't get cocky!
Someone like you doesn't need any rules!
How dare you do that, you bastard?!
Well, you said I didn't need any rules.
Didn't you say something about taking care of me with just your pinky?
Otoishi, my senpai?
I'm going to kill you.
You already said that earlier!
This agony and pain...
What am I supposed to take it out on?
This rage...
Who do I proclaim it to?!
He's amazing...
Right-Hand Tapping
I'm going to kill
your mommas, too!
I was able to fully express my heart!
I was able to express the ultimate rage.
Just try it, Otoishi!
Wh-What? The user just...
but the user himself was actually able to move behind me?
Th-That's not it, Josuke!
I saw what happened from here.
It wasn't Otoishi that moved...
It was you!
You were moved!
What?
Chili Pepper came out and turned Shining Diamond
You're facing the ocean, aren't you?
Chili Pepper came out?
Koichi! I haven't seen Chili Pepper at all!
He's underneath the ground!
His upper body came up from there just now!
There must be electrical wires running all over under there!
I'm strong when I reflect on my actions.
Behind you to your right! There it is!
Now it's behind you!
It keeps running back into the electrical wires!
And at light speed!
Jotaro's the only one who can keep up, after all!
You don't have time to dig up the asphalt
and cut all the wires underground, Josuke Higashikata.
And the more big holes you make in the ground...
The more places I can pop up from!
Josuke! To your right!
In front of you!
Behind you!
No, wait! Um...
It's like insanely hard whack-a-mole!
He's moving too fast for me to tell where he'll come from!
You should really stop relying on guesswork!
Josuke...
And I still have two minutes left...
That's plenty of time to finish you.
Koichi, watch where Chili Pepper comes from and tell me.
I can't tell because I'm too close!
I-I can't tell, either!
Every time I think he's out, he goes back in!
Watch carefully, Koichi.
You should be able to tell what I'm thinking by now.
Huh? What you're thinking?
I-It's all squishy!
The asphalt's been turned into coal tar...
And the grates are covered by the oil film from the coal tar!
I got it!
Which means...
Behind you, to your left!
Gurb
Yeah! Bull's eye!
Bull's eye? That's great.
Do I get a prize
if I keep hitting him?
Chi
Chili
Chili Pe
Chili Pep
Chili Pepper
Akira
Akira Oto
Akira Otoishi
It's the boat! I can see the !
W-We're almost there!
Don't let your guard down yet.
Huh?
Wh-What the hell is that?
Josuke! Koichi!
I-It's so bright!
It seems that I wasn't taking you seriously enough, Josuke Higashikata.
don't you think?
I'm concentrating all of Morioh's electricity on my Chili Pepper.
The reason I didn't do so before
would be drained to zero for a while!
But I don't care anymore!
After I defeat you two, I just need to fly over there using the RC plane's battery
and kill Joseph!
I-I can't see!
You bastard...
J-Josuke actually got overpowered!
Josuke!
Do you see?
I'll be sure to tack the cost of all the electricity
This is the end, Josuke!
A t-tire?!
By the time you realize it, it's probably too late.
You blew up that tire on purpose, didn't you?
So you could fix it and trap my Stand inside the tire's rubber!
That's right! Tire rubber is an insulator, so it doesn't conduct electricity!
Chili Pepper won't be able to use electricity!
Damn it!
Yes! Now we just have to wait for Jotaro...
Just kidding.
Huh?
You were going to insulate me with tire rubber?
It might have worked if it were about a meter thick!
Don't make me laugh!
You dumbass!
Bomu
You've lost, Josuke!
Great. You would have been much better off
if you didn't have the power to break through that tire.
Th-The air from inside the tire!
It was completely full?!
N-Not the ocean! The ocean is very bad!
O-Oh, yeah...
Salt water conducts electricity.
Since the ocean's so vast, the electricity will spread out in every direction!
I'm sorry! Please!
Pull me out of here!
but it seems that it's your entire character that's foolish.
I-I'm dispersing...
His Stand's been split up! Which means...
H-He's dead?
Jotaro!
We defeated the user!
Well done. That's a relief.
So this guy is Josuke's dad...
His body's huge, but he's a rickety-looking geezer.
what's your name?
I-It's Okuyasu.
Okuyasu?
I'm Josuke's neighbor, and I'm also a Stand user.
Huh?
A Stand user.
Huh?
A S-t-a-n-d u-s-e-r!
Ah, you can't stand losers?
I'm a Stand user!
Oh, I see! So you're a Stand user.
Must be rough.
Ah!
Sorry about that. It's right in my hand.
Is this geezer okay?
Mr. Joestar.
By the way, Osomatsu, I have a question.
Has Josuke...
Since I didn't even know he was born and
I can't say that he's said much about that.
I see. So he hasn't...
Yay! It's finally here!
Look, Josuke!
Yeah, that's good, I guess.
Josuke...
and things ended happily ever after.
But you know...
I've never even met this guy before.
I can't really see him as my parent.
I'm sure it's just going to be awkward for the both of us.
Not that I have a grudge against him or anything.
But I have to think about what my mom'll think, too.
Don't you think so, Koichi?
O-Oh, no...
Josuke, there's trouble!
Th-The body!
Jotaro, there's trouble!
Akira Otoishi's body disappeared!
He's still
alive!
There's trouble! The enemy has boarded the boat!
It appears that Akira Otoishi was not dead!
Seriously?
Take Mr. Joestar...
Who are you?
Huh? Did you say something?
No, he...
I'm the one who said it!
Wha...
What?!
He's the enemy!
Seriously? You bastard!
Please wait!
Would any enemy actually do that?!
He's the real enemy!
You've got a point.
I'm the one who pointed out the enemy first!
Th-That's also a good point...
He is!
D'oh!
I have to choose again?
Damn it.
Okuyasu's easy to deal with.
Jotaro hasn't seen my face yet.
If I can just kill Joseph...
I'm gonna escape!
Chili Pepper!
Huh? What's that about a chilly pigeon?
Rumble
I'll kill you!
I figured out
who it is!
It's you!
Don't think you can fool Okuyasu Nijimura twice!
H-How did you figure it out?
You wanna know?
How...
I was gonna punch both of you! I'm not very smart, you know.
Watch...
your step. You're gonna fall into the ocean.
S-Sorry.
but it broke a moment ago...
G-Guess I don't have a choice.
Hold on to my hand.
I just had a great idea!
Why not have Shining Diamond fix the cane?
Y-You idiot! What are you saying?
You're so stupid, Okuyasu.
Huh? Why?
Things are better if he doesn't fix it this time.
Huh? Why?
Why is that?
Now if we just
including the threat to this town.
Episode 13 We Picked Up Something Crazy!
Episode 13 Something Crazy!
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 We Picked Up Something Crazy!
Next on Morioh Radio, we have a letter from "Troubled Lonesome Boy."
"Kai, listen to this.
I wonder if she's mad because I proposed suddenly.
And I spent all my pay on an engagement ring with a ruby, her birthstone...
So you were able to successfully retrieve the bow and arrow.
Yeah, from Akira Otoishi's place.
He'd been committing burglaries with his Stand.
Roughly 500 million yen worth.
Try doing something with your Stand again.
I'll send you to the ends of the Earth and kill you there.
I'll be safest in prison!
Chili Pepper's in pieces.
Jotaro, what are you going to do with the bow and arrow?
The Speedwagon Foundation is going to hold on to it and research it.
It's a crucial piece of evidence we can use to unravel the mystery behind Stands.
That's great.
Thank goodness!
It didn't end up being that big a deal, but yay! Hooray!
I'm still questioning Otoishi about the Stand
Stay on your guard, just in case.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
Coffee in Japan is still the best.
Whoa! Jeez.
Josuke, don't you have to go? The bus will be here soon.
R-Right...
Yeah. Come on, let's go. Stand up.
I wonder if those two will be okay.
Whoa, this cake is so good!
Hello, this is the Higashikata resid—
Hey, Mom. It's me.
Josuke? It's unusual for you to call me.
Do you need something?
Well, uh... Hey, y-you're going to be home all day today, right?
Yeah? What about it?
N-Nothing! As long as you're there, it's fine. Bye!
Hey!
Crap. I hope Mom didn't think that was weird.
Oh, for crying out loud...
I told him to wait until I was done with the phone call!
Hey, wait!
Hello? Can you hear me? Hey!
Did you just call for me?
And... I know I'm being pushy, but I'm going to confirm one more time.
You can only look from a distance.
Make sure you don't talk to my mom!
My mom won't be happy just because you came to visit.
She's gonna be a wreck.
I know that. I promise.
Also, one more thing.
I'm gonna be calling you Mr. Joestar.
Huh?
W-Well, you know... I might as well lay it on the line now.
but calling someone I just met "Dad" or "Pops" is just not happening.
So after you see my mom, I want you to go right back to America.
Right...
Man, this is awkward.
Hey, Mr. Joestar...
Excuse me, did you see where the burly old man who was just here went?
He got onto that long-distance bus.
Bright Deer
Long Distance Bus
To Sapporo
Y-You can't be serious! Damn it!
I'm sorry about that.
But I'm surprised you caught up to the bus by running.
We were just about to get onto the freeway.
Right now, I'm thinking it might have been better to just let you go...
To Hokkaido!
Ugh, my stomach hurts.
Sorry about that.
Josuke...
Something seems to be pulling on my trousers.
Oh, really? Don't let them drag you off somewhere again.
Wha...
J-Josuke! There's a Stand user nearby!
Yup, there sure is. Two, in fact... Me and you.
Anyway, is there a vending machine nearby? I need a drink.
Wh-What is this? They're not footsteps.
Hands? Hand prints?
Oh my God! Josuke, the Stand just laughed!
See? Right here! On top of the sand!
There's no way I'm letting him see my mom.
Now he's seeing and hearing things.
This is concrete!
Where did you go? It's gone!
Great. This old man is seriously bad news.
Hermit Purple!
Get out of here, you mutt! Shoo! Shoo!
Do you hear something crying?
It's right here, Josuke.
A baby! There's a naked baby right here.
I can tell when I'm touching it. It's invisible!
What?!
I-It's there!
It's really there!
It's all squishy.
Well, I'll be damned.
It's an invisible baby!
It feels like it's only about six months old or so.
But how did a baby turn invisible out here?
I'm assuming it's a Stand ability, but...
There are a lot of questions, like, "Why did the enemy
Josuke, I think the baby is actually the Stand user.
It's a Stand user without realizing it.
Huh?
Even adults can develop ulcers, spot baldness, and gray hair
I believe that finding its mother will be the way to solve this.
H-Hey, just hurry up and make it stop crying.
I-I'm not really sure what to do, either.
There, there...
Th-This is...
Did you figure something out?
Yes, when I just touched it now.
It's a little girl.
Right, the way to tell if it's a boy or a girl is between the legs!
Did you find out something else?
do you have any tissues?
Th-That smell...
I-It's invisible, so I couldn't tell for sure until I could smell it.
And I just scratched my beard with this hand!

I'm returning your manuscript to you.
I'll be looking forward to those fixes for the volumes, Sensei.
For the time being, we're gonna have to get milk and diapers.
And since she's naked, we need to get her some clothes.
I'm counting on you, Mr. Joestar.
What? I-I'm buying them?
Of course. Look at me.
There'd be rumors that
But I only have American traveler's checks.
Oh, fine...
You can use my credit card.
Sorry about that.
Don't buy anything too expensive.
I've worked hard to build up my savings, and I don't have much!
I got it, I got it.
Welcome.
Can I help you find something?
Um... Do you carry disposable diapers?
Of course! Is this your first time here?
Yes, it is, but...
These diapers are easy to change, even if you're living on your own.
Silky Smooth Underwear For Adults
You won't have to worry overnight, either.
Um... I'm looking for a baby, not myself.
P-Pardon me! So you're looking for baby diapers.
Were you looking for cloth diapers, or disposable pull-ups?
Uh... What was that?
I-I don't really know, so could you just...
What size do you need?
Size?
How old is the baby?
Th-There are that many options nowadays?
W-Well, she's a girl, and when I held her, she was about this big.
What do you mean by "when I held her," sir?
It'd be inconvenient for us if you bought diapers
Oh, all right. Give me all of the sizes.
I also need baby wipes, powdered milk, and baby bottles...
For baby bottles, we have glass or plastic.
Huh?
The plastic ones are light, but may have a noticeable smell.
Which one would you like?
U-U-Uh... Um...
We also have various shapes and designs.
We have ones shaped like rocket ships and racing cars.
This one, the baby can hold by itself.
And this one, if you turn it upside-down, the doll inside moves.
I-I have no idea, so if you could just throw in a few...
And which bottle nipples would you like, sir?
Rubber ones are soft, but don't last very long.
Silicon ones last, but are a bit hard.
This one is called a "Chupatoreni."
and the flow of milk is adjusted by how hard the baby sucks on it.
This is a NUK from Germany.
And just like when drinking breast milk, it will not come out
O-Oh, all right. Whatever is fine. Just give me all of them.
As for the nipple holes, we have round, Y-shaped, and cross-shaped varieties.
J-Just give me all of them.
I'll be paying by card.
Thank you very much, sir.
130,000... I don't really understand yen that well.
I wonder how much that is in dollars.
If 100 yen is about 80 cents...
Well, whatever.
I'm sure it can't be that expensive.
Damn it...
What's he doing? He's taking forever.
By the way...
The girl who got the ring. I wonder what happened with that.
Since he didn't get an answer, I wonder if that was a no.
They could be super conflicted about it.
I can't stay here...
If people from school find me here...
Sorry to keep you waiting, Josuke.
Here's your card back.
You're done? A-All right, let's go.
Now we won't have to worry about losing sight of her, but...
If strangers see that she doesn't have a face, they'll be creeped out.
I thought about that and...
bought some makeup, too.
Let's try some foundation first. There we go!
Hey, I think she might actually be cute.
My, what a beauty!
This face will help us find her mom.
We've finally got some hope. We can do this!
That was a good idea!
Good, good! All right, now let's try some lipstick.
And let's draw on some eyebrows and eyelashes... Like that.
I knew he'd do that...
So this geezer's the type to get carried away when you compliment him.
Now we can finally take you around without having to worry too much.
We can't put makeup on your eyes, so we'll just have to use sunglasses.
That looks great!
Here's some milk.
Maybe I went too light on the foundation.
It looks like it's starting to come off...
Th-That's not it!
What is this?! Sh-She's...
Sh-She disappeared! And so did my hands!
This baby's not just making herself invisible!
Mr. Joestar! Let go of the baby!
I'm telling you to hurry up and let go of the baby!
Th-They're still invisible, even though I let go of her.
She's powering up!
This isn't good.
It looks like everything within about thirty centimeters
But this doesn't make sense.
who could even feed her or take care of her?
So it must be due to feelings of anxiety.
It's stress.
If she powers up any more, no one will be able to get near her.
We'll end up invisible, too.
That's some weird junk. I wonder who's gonna clean it up.
Well, I guess someone will do it.
Look out!
What happened?
This lit cigarette butt was... Oh, you can't see it.
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Joestar?!
Don't space out at a time like this!
I, uh...
The stroller completely disappeared!
And the ground, too!
So it is stress!
That's the sound of the stroller flipping over!
The invisible baby... fell into the water?!
Wh-Where is she? Make some noise!
J-Josuke...
Shut up!
This all happened because he couldn't keep it together.
That stupid old geezer!
This irresponsible guy is my father?
He's so irresponsible, he was okay with abandoning my mom for sixteen years.
There's no way in hell I can respect someone like him.
There's no way we can get along.
You stay out of this.
Where is she? She should be right around here.
I don't care if I turn invisible, too.
Come on!
She's not here... Hurry!
Damn it! How the hell am I supposed to find
Josuke, I...
I mean...
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm adding color to the water...
It's the center...
The child is in the center.
Mr. Joestar...
No one else would think to do this.
They wouldn't go this far.
I wanted to look cool
in front of you.

Episode 14 Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1
Episode 14 , Part 1
Today was another exhausting day.
I just want to hurry home so I can relax.
K-Koichi...
Hazamada...
Hey, how are you doing?
Th-Thanks for everything the other day.
Um, are you all healed up now?
Kinda. I was released from the hospital two days ago.
Where's that bastard— I mean, where's Josuke?
He already went home.
Is she a Stand user?
Apparently.
So is Mr. Joestar going to be in town for a while, then?
Probably.
I see. By the way, Koichi, do you like to read manga?
Manga? Oh, I guess about as much as anyone.
Have you heard of Rohan Kishibe, who draws ?
? Of course!
Yeah? You like it?
I guess you'd call it "horror suspense."
and the realistic characters are great, aren't they?
Right, right!
Did you know that Rohan Kishibe actually lives in Morioh?
Huh?!
What?! He lives in Morioh?!
No way! You can't be serious! Really?!
I couldn't believe it, either!
But I happened to overhear some realtors talking.
I know it seems unbelievable, but it's true!
Hey, want to go see if we can get some autographs?
Morioh Station
Yes! Of course I'll go!
Rohan Kishibe's House
Looks like we think alike!
Really?
Kishibe
Over there!
I think that might be his studio.
The light's on!
You're right...
I wonder if he has any other family.
I heard he lives alone.
Twenty?! He's so young!
So he became a pro at my age.
There's no point in snooping around, Koichi.
Try ringing the doorbell.
M-Me?
Oh, come on! I'm ordering you, as an older student.
I tend to get pretty nervous.
What? That's not fair...
 Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1
That face!
Rohan Kishibe!
He looks just like his picture in the New Year's deluxe edition!
Uh, I mean... Rohan-sensei!
H-Huh?
Who are you two?
What are you doing? Playing a prank?
N-No! We would never!
W-We're fans of yours, Sensei.
Fans? Of mine? You're readers?
So my address has gotten out.
N-No, um... I just happened to overhear it.
Fans of mine, eh?
That's good.
Huh?
Nothing, never mind. Pardon.
An autograph or two is no problem at all.
Yes! I guess it's a good thing we came.
I know.
Since you're here, would you like a tour of my studio?
Huh?
You'll let us go into your studio?!
I'm already done with my work for the day, so if you two would like...
Of course!
Then...
Pardon the intrusion!
Come in.
Wow!
Wow! Raw 4-color manuscript!
This is amazing! It has so much more impact!
I-I'm so moved! I-I-I'm so glad that we came!
How long have you been working in Morioh?
I moved here three months ago.
but I lived here for a time when I was a child.
Tokyo is very convenient, but it's pretty chaotic.
The environment is nowhere near
You could say there's no point in living in
Um... So what do you do for assistants or staff?
I don't have any. I draw it all by myself.
Huh? All by yourself?!
You draw 19 pages of such elaborate art in just one week?!
I can draw them in four days. Five if there are color pages.
What?!
On the remaining days, I have fun going on trips and such.
If I had an assistant, it'd be harder for me to work.
That's so amazing... Wow.
You're a genius!
Pardon me for a moment.
Whoa, a s-spider!
We really are out in the burbs.
Um... Sensei?
I see... So this spider is an ...
It can be found in houses and mountainous regions all across Japan.
do you two know what it takes to draw an interesting manga?
Reality!
but that's not actually true!
For example, in the city, people would just be grossed out by this spider and kill it.
and what its innards look like.
When a spider's belly is cut upon, how does it suffer before it dies?
You have to know these things for the sake of reality.
That's so cruel!
Cruel?!
An amateur brat like you is criticizing me, Rohan Kishibe?!
N-No! I wasn't criticizing at all! I'm sorry!
I should have a taste, too.
Manga artists are really strange people, just as the world perceives them!
Very nice! That agonized expression...
Perfect example of how one looks when puking!
I should sketch it.
R-Really?
Now it looks fake.
Forget it. I won't sketch it.
It won't be of any use.
I-I'm sorry.
Autographs, wasn't it?
and bring out some tea, as well.
Oh, you don't have to...
But that's amazing! I had no idea...
 must be so amazing
Um, Hazamada...
I know we just got here, but, um...
Maybe we should go home.
Huh? Go home? You want to go home? Why?
This is a lot of fun!
I don't really have a reason, but...
I guess you could call it a hunch.
Though I'm not usually that perceptive...
I just suddenly got the feeling that Rohan-sensei is a bit dangerous.
Dangerous?
No! Nothing like that. Just, um...
I don't think you should just assume that he's a Stand user.
I'm not assuming that he is...
I just said I have a bad feeling.
That means I have something in common with a famous manga artist.
But, all right.
We can always come again.
But!
Only after I've looked at this thing that caught my eye.
Thing? What thing?
Jeez, you're dense, Koichi!
Look carefully.
Oh! C-Could this be...
Yup! He said he just finished working, right?
A manuscript for that's just been finished?!
Does that mean no one else has even seen it yet?!
Once I get a glimpse of this, we can go home.
We should get permission first.
Koichi, you don't know manga artists at all.
There's no way he'd let us outsiders read a
I'll have a look, then put it right back.
That's an even worse idea!
It's fine! It's not like it can hurt anything.
Huh?
What is this feeling?
I'm getting goosebumps!
It's so good!
I'm so moved!
It appears
that my manuscript was compatible with you two after all.
I thought you would read it.
And only those who are the first to read my manuscript, and are compatible...
H-Hazamada...
K-Koichi...
...will have their hearts opened by my ability, Heaven's Door!
A-Ability?!
My hand!
K-Koichi! What's going on?!
Morioh Landmark 5 Manga Artist Rohan Kishibe's House Get off at the Morioh Kotodai 2-chome bus stop and walk 1 minute. Area: A mansion situated on 103 tsubo of land. 7LDK plus an attic. If you actually go, he'll pretend to be out.
There are a lot of things recorded in the human body.
Everything from the moment you were born.
In order to read that, I will turn you both into books.
Books that have your lives written in them.
Help!
You read the manga too, didn't you?
It's happening to me, too!
Hazamada!
This will cause you no actual harm, so don't worry.
Wh-What are you trying to do?!
I told you earlier that for manga, the author's sense of reality is important, right?
Which means reading about your lives and
You can't get this from interviews!
You're going to tell me 100% realistically, as if I had experienced it myself.
Koichi Hirose. Born March 28th, 1984, at 6:27 AM at Red Cross Hospital in S City.
You were born premature at 2325 grams, and spent a week in an incubator.
You're from a family of four, and your older sister's name is Ayana...
and your personality is very honest.
That's very commendable.
You...
What is this ability that you have?! Reverb?
Someone other than me has an ability like this?!
You, too?
"Stand users!" This is...
Everything from April of 1999 on is amazing!
You've only had amazing experiences ever since!
I can't believe it...
I just discovered the best material a manga artist could hope for, Koichi Hirose!
Wh-What do you plan on doing with us?!
I'm going to take your memories
Reverb!
Please stop attacking us with your Stand immediately!
Otherwise...
Are you going to have Reverb Act 2 attack me with sound?
Yes! Please release me from your Stand!
I know. It's written on your 11th page.
but when it's necessary, you have courage that can overpower your fear.
Truly magnificent!
I'm very impressed with you!
I'm sure my readers will like your personality, too.
I'm not bluffing! I'm really going to attack you!
Oh, shut up...
And just try it!
Reverb Act 2!
Crash
Crash
Huh? I-I missed?!
Did you accidentally miss or did you miss on purpose?
Your control is way off!
Then how about this?!
Crash
Where are you attacking?!
Koichi, sadly for you, I have put a safety lock on Reverb.
Huh?
You are now unable to attack me.
Safety lock?
Look... I've already written it into your 11th page, right here.
I can not attack the manga artist, Rohan Kishibe
c
an
n
ot
can not
This is Heaven's Door's ability.
You will now never be able to harm me in any way, shape, or form.
Wh-What?!
But that's all I'm going to mess with.
so it wouldn't benefit my work at all.
Let's see... I guess I'll have a look at Hazamada, too.
Sensei! You are a genius! I admire you!
Huh... I see.
Let's see...
You're an awful man.
You're useless.
No fair! There's no hope for me!
Why?
Why are you doing this?
The world knows that!
You're living in this amazing house at the age of twenty!
You're doing much better than most people your age!
And yet, why do you need my memories?!
Do you think that I, Rohan Kishibe, draw manga
I'm drawing manga so people will read it!
So someone will read it! That's the only reason!
It's a very simple reason, but I don't care about anything else!
So that people will read it, I look for realistic material every day!
Listen well. Whenever I finish a manuscript, I feel amazing.
Everyone feels great after finishing work, don't they?
But that feeling only lasts for an instant.
These feelings have been reoccurring over and over since I was sixteen.
Keicho Nijimura...
Yes, that was also written in you.
I'm sure you two don't understand the feeling of having found
But this is it, right now!
It's the best!
Koichi, I'm going to make your reality mine!
See, Koichi? Wasn't Rohan-sensei a great guy?
Aren't you glad we went?
Yeah! It was so much fun!
To Hirose Rohan Kishibe
I'd love to go again.
Yeah. Let's definitely go again.
Well, I'm heading this way, so...
He really was a great guy.
You'll never speak of this, Koichi.
Huh?!
Wh-Why?!
How did I lose 20 kilograms?
But I don't look any different!
It reads five kilograms...
The scale's not broken.
Th-This is impossible!
Th-This has to be the work of an enemy Stand user!
Otherwise, there's no way I'd lose 20 kilograms!
But who...
I need to talk to Josuke about this.
What's the matter, Ko?
Huh?
Me? U-Uh...
Wait... What was it?
What are you talking about? Weirdo.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing. My little brother's wandering around in his underwear.
What was it?
Well, if I forgot about it, it can't be that important.
Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.
Huh?
Th-This house...
Why?
I somehow ended up walking to Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.
The door's open...
He might actually still be asleep since he's a manga artist.
I really shouldn't just barge into his house.
Hey, did you see that, Okuyasu?
Yeah...
We followed Koichi because he was heading in the
Whose house is that?
I have my doubts, but it's not some chick, is it?
Rohan-sensei...
He's working so frantically.
But I wonder what it is...
What is it?
I'm glad you came.
I've been waiting for you. You're right on time.
Episode 15 Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 2
Episode 15 , Part 2
What was it?
Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.
Huh?
Th-This house...
Why?
I somehow ended up walking to Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.
The door's open...
but then I'd be late for school. It's probably a bad idea.
He might still be asleep, since he's a manga artist.
I really shouldn't just barge into his house.
It's a bad idea...
Rohan-sensei...
He's working so frantically.
But I wonder what it is...
I can't shake the feeling that being here is actually terrifying.
What is it?
I'm glad you came.
I've been waiting for you.
Huh?
However, could I ask you to wait a little while?
Two more pages, and I'll be done with the manuscript for next week.
I think I'll be done in about twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes?
Did I hear him wrong?
Two totally blank pages of manuscript in twenty minutes?
No way... And he said next week's?
We only just read this week's manuscript yesterday, and he'd just finished it.
What?! You're not going to do pencils first?!
I-I can't believe it...
It's getting more and more complete... And he's even drawing the backgrounds with it!
Wh-What was that just now?!
What?! H-He's doing the beta!
and hitting exactly the right spots without going out of the lines!
Th-This technique...
Aren't you supposed to fill in beta by hand with a brush?!
Boom
He's already done with the beta!
It's only been about two minutes since the page was completely white!
It's all thanks to you, Koichi.
The urge to work keeps welling up in me!
I want to draw so bad, I can't help it!
I just want to keep drawing!
This is the first time I've been able
I'm drawing a masterpiece right now!
Your experiences are amazing!
It's because I'm using your experience as the source of my story, Koichi!
Huh?
What...
Hurry! I want your next reality!
Let me see your next page!
Because you're going to become a masterpiece and live forever!
Flip
I-I remember now!
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
Hey, now...
 Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 2
This is amazing!
I'm going read this now, Koichi.
Oh, my...
How curious.
Why would those two be at my house?
There's no way Koichi would tell those two about me.
How strange...
Huh?
I-It's Josuke and Okuyasu!
N-Now they can save me somehow!
Somehow...
I have to get them to save me!
Huh? Okuyasu and Josuke?
How did you know I was here?
Now, then...
Right now, I don't have any interest in Josuke and Okuyasu.
I'm so excited!
Huh? You were watching a manga artist do his work?
This is where that manga artist works?
Is he famous or something?
Have you heard of him, Josuke?
Nah. Even that bastard Hazamada
That wasn't it.
But what was it?
Well, we were following you because we were worried
but if nothing's wrong, then good. I'm relieved.
Thanks.
Nah, I'll pass.
I'd get nervous around somebody famous.
Same here.
See ya, Koichi.
Okay.
I know I'm forgetting something.
I remember now!
I-I was going to ask for help!
Josuke! Okuyasu!
I'll head to school soon!
Sure!
Don't be late.
Got it!
N-No!
That's not what I wanted to say!
I can not attack the manga artist, Rohan Kishibe
can not
It's no use! I can't ask them for help.
C-Can there be a Stand as terrifying as this?!
Heaven's Door is way too strong! There's no way to attack it!
Scribble Scribble Scribble
Ah, I see...
Scribble Scribble Scribble
At this rate, he's going to rip everything out of me and kill me!
Stop
Someone's coming into this mansion!
What did you do downstairs just now, Koichi?
Huh?
Okuyasu!
Whoa, there! Don't you dare turn around.
Try anything funny, and I'll crush you with my Stand, you little shit.
Okuyasu!
It appears he figured it out coincidentally.
I just realized, but the wound on your hand
It looks like you scratched it or caught it on something while crawling.
I-I was so absorbed, I didn't even notice...
That's how you figured it out, right, Okuyasu Nijimura?
Wha...
What? Who the hell is this guy?
Hey, Koichi, tell me what this guy's Stand is!
W-Well...
I-I can't!
I can't say anything that'll put Rohan Kishibe at a disadvantage.
If you see even one panel, you lose!
Don't look at that manga!
Hey, I told you not to move!
I'll have to turn you into material, too.
You bastard!
What?!
H-He's fast!
Okuyasu!
What the hell is this?!
you're there, aren't you?
Ro
Rohan
Rohan Kishi
Rohan Kishibe
Hea

Heaven
Heaven's
Heaven's Do
Heaven's Doo
Heaven's Door
Okuyasu!
What the hell is up with this manga artist?
Oh, shut up.
Now, then... Koichi, I have a question for you.
Huh?
Why do you think Josuke Higashikata
Well? What do you think?
Josuke is hiding so he won't see your manga.
Yes, that is correct. You're pretty smart.
But unfortunately, because of that, Josuke Higashikata now knows who I really am.
There's also another reason that Josuke Higashikata is hiding behind the door.
What do you think that is?
I have to somehow drag him out from behind that door.
He's in the middle of trying to figure out how he's going to kill you!
That's also true.
The correct answer is...
Josuke Higashikata is contemplating whether
Josuke would never do that!
Right, Koichi.
It was written in your files that Josuke Higashikata's personality
But you see, manga artists have a habit of thinking about
Like, what are all of the possible actions
In this case, having Josuke run away now that he knows who I really am
Run... Actually, that might be a good idea.
Ah! We could win with her hair!
Do that, Josuke! Hurry up and let them know!
You fools!
Okuyasu! I already wrote that into your body!
Huh?
I'll allow you to explain what I wrote in there to those two, Koichi.
No!
What's written there, Koichi?
B-But that's... No...
We can't run anymore!
You can't run away from this!
I'm asking you what's written there, Koichi!
If Josuke Higashikata makes trouble for Rohan Kishibe, I will commit suicide by self-immolation
If Josuke Higashikata makes trouble for Rohan Kishibe, I will commit suicide by self-immolation
S-Suicide?!
You'll commit suicide if Josuke even tries to help us!
H-Hey, hey! I'll commit suicide by self-immolation?
Don't be stupid! Like I'd die in such a horrific way!
Huh?
But you will! He's invincible!
Stop! My right hand!
So you've come out.
It's not that he came out, but he was basically dragged out.
Ah... That's rather childish and simple, but it might be quite effective.
This room is small and there's nowhere to run.
Josuke!
Closing his eyes is pretty simple, but it might be a good idea.
As long as he doesn't see the manuscript, Heaven's Door is powerless.
Just come charging straight in like that!
Which means...
I just need to open your eyes somehow.
Oh! He was able to withstand that.
If he comes charging at me, I'll be finished.
If I were a protagonist in a manga, what would I do in this situation?
seconds
How would I get him to open his eyes?
Go, Josuke!
Hurry up, Josuke!
I know!
There! This is it!
I'm going to laugh at your hairstyle, Josuke!
That's from, like, twenty or thirty years ago!
You actually think that's cool?
How's that?
Looks like he gets angry if I say that.
It's sort of hard to believe, but the file doesn't lie.
What did you say just now?
J-Josuke, calm down!
Just try and say that one more time!
You opened them...
Didn't you hear me?
It's lame!
Though a dirty little bird might like to make your head its nest.
That's just a maybe, though.
Heaven's Door!
I've won.
Huh?!
What?!
Wh-What was that?
I-I know that I opened his eyes and showed him the manuscript!
W-We're back to normal!
I'm certain that I showed it to him... Why?
Where the hell did you fly off to?!
Come back out here, damn it!
No, he totally didn't see...
He didn't see?
Where are you hiding, you dumbass?!
Get out here!
Yeah... He's the kind of guy that loses sight
I had no idea he actually got this mad.
This is way worse than I imagined.
What?
S-Something about Josuke's personality that Koichi didn't know?
That means it's information that's not in the file!
Why? Why does he get so mad about his hairstyle?
There has to be a reason... Why?
I won't forgive anyone who disses my hair!
I won't keep quiet, no matter who it is!
The reason behind his hair...
That just might be why...
Huh? What are you talking about?
It has to do with when Josuke was a kid, but...
This story is going to include my own
and for fifty days, they weren't sure whether he'd live or die.
Josuke...
He found out later that it was right around the time
But on that day, Morioh was hit with its worst blizzard in 18 years.
It's no use... What should I do?
I should have called an ambulance at the house.
I shouldn't have brought Josuke out in this snow.
That's when it happened.
Wh-What do you want? Go away!
That kid is sick, right? I'll push your car for you.
Huh?
Hurry up and step on the gas.
Once you get moving, don't stop. Just keep going... Or your tires will get stuck in the snow again.
O-Okay...
Thank you!
the four-year-old Josuke thought that what the boy did
because it's the same as insulting him.
I think that story might be the reason.
Huh... I had no idea something like that happened.
Rohan's holding a pen!
Bastard! You're going to try again?!
N-No...
What a wonderful story! And I just experienced something amazing.
I'm so happy.
If I can make it work in my own project...
I'm so lucky.
It's no use.
At this point, you have to commend him.
Putting good and bad aside, I have to admire that attitude.
He really is a super manga artist.
There you are, manga artist!
I'm not done punching you!
You sort of have to commend him, too.
Y-Yeah...
Sorry!

Episode 16 Let's Go Hunting!
Episode 16 ing!
M-Move, arm!
The Hamon will fill my head!
I have to do something before that happens!
Lord Dio!
We'll find you a new body.
An excerpt from the December 4, 1888 edition of The London Press:
"73 of the 452 people living in Wind Knights Lot went missing overnight."
"Investigators have one lead based on witness accounts."
"Four outsiders were seen burning a man's clothing at the cliff's base."
"One of them was seen smashing an curious stone mask with a hammer."
Our work is done!
Two stars fallen from the heavens
Swallowed by waters swirling light and dark
Their ripples move outward, pulled toward each other
The sun will guide the man who walks the path of honor
And for the man who follows his ambition...
...a sacrifice awaits
With pounding heart and burning will
With thundering fists
And overflowing bravery
He steps forward, free of doubt
A fate determined by his blood
JoJo!
Chapter 9: The Last Hamon
Joestar heir Jonathan Joestar weds
They plan to spend their honeymoon in America.
Good heavens!
Look at the time!
They're about to depart!
Hey!
Hi, Mr. Speedwagon!
You almost missed seeing them off!
Sorry I'm late. So where are they?
They're on the ship.
It's about to set sail.
What?!
Where can I see them?!
Father STYX...
...we expect much from your mission to Mexico.
I'll do what I can.
Jonathan! Where are you?!
Gangway!
What weighs so much in this thing?
How should I know? Some weird Asian told me to move it.
Hey. Did you guys hear that?
Quit flapping your gums and move!
We don't get paid till the job's done!
Ouch! What a bunch of louts!
Mr. Speedwagon!
Look! There they are!
Hey!
Mr. Joestar!
What a joyous occasion!
Make a happy life for yourselves!
I'll always be here for you. If you need me, I'll come running!
Though I might just get in the way.
Mr. Joestar!
Bon voyage!
-Atlantic Ocean, en route to America-
One bird all alone, separated from its flock?
Erina...
Is something wrong?
Why are you crying?
These are tears of joy.
Because I am with you.
And now the proud Jonathan Joestar is in my arms.
I feel the same way.
When my heart was frozen in despair, you came and warmed me.
I am happy to have saved a world with you living in it.
I wish Dad could've met you.
Erina, let's go and eat!
Jonathan!
I was about to tell you to watch your head.
I hope today never ends.
Crap, that's the engine room. It sure fell into a filthy place.
I could just sell it, but it makes me money.
Dear Lord...
You sure do like picking on me.
I couldn't. I've never had alcohol.
Try a little. Just a sip. It's not that strong.
Give it a taste.
Here.
Y-You're...!
Jonathan?
No!
There's no way...
Dio is...alive...
Erina, go to our room and don't forget to lock the door!
What's with this trunk? The lock is open.
That's funny. I can see a catch glinting inside.
That means...the trunk is locked from the inside!
Stop!
You're...!
Is my new body here?
D-Dio!
Jonathan is worried. There's something wrong.
JoJo, look. See what has become of me.
There is a reason I come before you in this state.
Why would I show you my weakness?
Because, JoJo, though I once despised you, I now respect you.
I respect your courage, your spirit and your power.
I realize that now.
Dio!
JoJo...
But because of you, the world has slipped from my grasp.
Our two existences are truly one.
I will take the body of the only man I respect
That is the destiny laid out for me!
You will feel no pain, that is my last gift to you!
His eyes...! No!
Live on as my body, JoJo!
Jonathan!
J-Jonathan...
Eri...na...
What a pity.
If you had just held still, it would have been a painless death.
Did JoJo never tell you of me, the mythical dweller in the dark?
I may not look like much, but surely you remember me, Erina Pendleton.
No, it's Mrs. Erina Joestar now, isn't it?
Dio!
The ship's full of monsters!
As you ordered, I drained the life of one passenger.
And now most of the ship has joined our family!
And now we go to America. Isn't that right, Lord Dio?
I can't speak.
I can't even breathe.
Erina... Erina!
I have to save...
I can't charge my Hamon.
Behold, Lord Dio!
The sniveling whelp can't breathe!
He'll cause no mischief with Hamon now!
This is what he gets for crossing you, Lord Dio.
Or shall I just wait a few minutes for him to suffocate, hmm?
Listen, Wang Chan!
I'll tolerate no insult to JoJo!
He is the man who brought me to my current state.
Show him some respect by severing his head painlessly.
Yes, Lord Dio.
And now my dear friend's body will become my future!
Jonathan!
He's up to something! Stay back!
He might have one last trick up his sleeve!
He can do nothing! Surely Lord Dio overestimates him!
Now I'll scoop out what little brains you have with my fingers!
Must...save Erina.
I'll have to use the last bit of Hamon left in my body all at once.
A little will do.
Look out, Wang Chan!
S-Something broke inside of my body. Something important.
N-No!
This... This is the end.
My last Hamon.
It was too weak to destroy that zombie completely.
But it was enough.
W-What the...?!
JoJo must have done something to Wang Chan's body!
He disrupted its functions without destroying it.
He's made it cling tightly to the machinery.
A-And the device it's clinging to...
...is the paddle's screw shaft!
The strength of a zombie is enough to stop the paddle!
If the shaft stops, the steam inside the piston will keep building up!
And after a while...
...the ship will explode!
Jonathan, this can't be.
How could this happen to us?
R-Run, Erina.
The s-ship will explode.
I don't know exactly what is going on.
It's too much for me. I don't know if I should cry or scream.
Maybe I should just faint away.
But I can say one thing.
Erina Joestar...
...will die with you.
In the warmth of these lips, alas, I feel the touch of death.
Jonathan Joestar is dying.
But we're together. I want to stay like this forever.
Until the ship explodes and everything burns.
Until everything is gone.
It's all right to cry.
But you...have to keep living.
It's like a storybook! 
To me, that heroism is cruelty.
My only wish is to die with you.
That woman died to save her child.
My mother did the same for me.
Go with the baby. Hurry!
You plan to destroy the whole ship!
JoJo, you really never give up!
But neither do I!
I will live! No matter what!
Along with your body!
Zombies!
Devour Wang Chan's body and restart the piston!
It's starting to explode.
Jonathan!
It's already exploding!
I have to protect myself from the sun at all times!
So I am already prepared in the event of an explosion!
Erina, take a good look!
Now that JoJo can't use Hamon, I can safely steal his body!
Then I will step into that trunk, my humble boudoir.
That little shelter can withstand a blast made by a ton of dynamite!
Here I come, JoJo!
And I bid you welcome, my new, eternal body!
Jonathan!
Dio...
Like you said, our fates might truly be one in the same.
I feel an odd warmth toward you.
Now our lives are bound completely.
And they will vanish along with this ship.
Fare...well...
...Erina.
Let me go, JoJo!
Release me! Think about it!
You'd like a shot at eternity, right?
I can heal your wounds! You can live forever with Erina, JoJo!
JoJo?!
He... He's...
He's dead.
Jonathan Joestar Died February 7, 1889
Jonathan Joestar passed away into oblivion.
His life was a piece of history invisible to ordinary people.
They will never hear the tale of his noble accomplishments.
But his descendants will.
The new life that was inside me
Erina Joestar was rescued soon after near the Canary Islands.
And the book of the stone mask closed for a time.
But this was only the beginning of a new adventure.
Part 1: Phantom Blood -- Fin
Next episode
It was the fall of 1938.
Nice to see you, Speedwagon.
How did you know that, bastard?
Take him down!
I'm Joseph Joestar. Call me JoJo.
Chapter 10: JoJo in New York
Josuke, I'm about to go hunting.
Huh?
Come with me.
Huh?
W-Wait a sec, Jotaro. Did you just say "hunting"?
Does that mean...
We're gonna be hunting down some chicks with nice bodies?
I'm a guy who's more into pure love, so I've never done that.
I wonder if I can do it...
Akira Otoishi confessed yesterday.
Otoishi did?!
Before his identity was revealed, he was using the bow and arrow.
He happened to shoot a rat with the arrow.
A rat?!
The rat didn't die after it was shot.
So even though it's a rat, this means that
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
Let's Go Hunting!
Wow, kewl!
This should be obvious, but it won't work against a Stand.
You'll only be able to use it to defeat the user.
What? I have to do it, too?
I don't know... My mind tends to wander when ball-shaped things are involved.
The second one was so close!
Not bad. I'd give it 85 points.
But before our pursuit, I'll give you a warning.
So don't fire until you're positive you'll hit it.
I'm not trying to put pressure on you, but remember that.
I'm feeling plenty pressured now.
Apparently, Akira Otoishi shot the rat
Given the area, it was probably a brown rat.
Brown rats can swim, live anywhere, and eat anything.
They can jump about 2 meters.
Found it.
Aren't those a bird's tracks?
Their front paws have four digits, and the back ones have five.
It's dragging something, forming this S-shape.
This line was made by its tail.
It's a rat that's around 20 centimeters long.
There's a tick on this leaf.
Without a doubt, there's a nest deep in that drainage channel.
For now, we'll set a trap here and video tape it.
That's one of those cameras that let you watch while you're taping, right?
You're not using cheese for the trap?
It's a crumb of tempura.
There sure are a lot of flies...
Jotaro!
Th-This is...
Rat corpses?
It's exactly what it looks like!
It's like the jelly from stewed fish.
Why the heck are you poking at it?!
It's flesh.
The flesh of these rats was melted once, then hardened again.
And they died from having the flesh under their skin melted.
What do you even do to leave behind a corpse like this?
I'm not sure...
It used its Stand?
It killed the others and made their territory its own.
Which means...
It's definitely making a nest at the end of this drainage channel.
But the question is
Looks like the drainage channel leads to that farm.
We might already be too late.
R-Really?
They have a chicken coop, but there aren't any chickens.
There are no signs of life at the house, either.
It doesn't look like they just went out, and the front door isn't locked.
The rat is there.
Let's go check out that house.
because it's confident that no slow human is going to catch it.
It's not expecting us to blast bearings at it.
That's how we'll get close enough to nail it in one shot.
Found something.
Rat droppings.
Not made up of grass or grain, either.
They're heading toward this room.
Let's check it out.
Right.
What is that?
The sound of a refrigerator's compressor?
What the heck?
Has the magnet in the door weakened?
What?! There it is!
Damn it! It's right there!
That's what opened the refrigerator just now!
Can rats actually open refrigerator doors?!
Nah... Someone living here must not have shut the door all the way.
And... Am I actually naïve enough to believe that?
This rat is a Stand user!
Jo—
Jotaro's not here!
He went to the next room.
Great. Now our eyes have met.
Th-This is...
Did that rat do this?!
They're still alive...
Are you telling me that rat used its Stand to turn the owners
And it's eating them!
Damn it... Jotaro's not coming back.
That means I'm gonna have to kill this thing.
If I don't get it in one try, it'll figure out my range.
That's what he said, right? Damn it...
Talk about pressure!
From here, the table and chair are slightly in the way.
I'm gonna make sure I blast this bearing right into your forehead.
Stay right there for a bit...
Shit! It stopped eating.
If I move any more, it might run away!
It's moving! Now!
Crush
Yes!
It wasn't a fatal blow!
There it is!
You're gonna try to attack me?
I'll get you with the next shot!
Crap! It's running under the table to get away!
I'm not going to let you!
Jotaro, what are you doing?!
That shape...
Shit! It's a Stand that shoots something!
What should I do? Slap it away with my bare hands?
But that's gross, so maybe not...
Which is it?
Did I hit it, or did I miss?
You bastard!
Yes! I nailed it!
I didn't hit it in the forehead, but I beat it.
That was close...
Jotaro, over here!
I got the rat! It's over!
Jeez. What were you doing?
I felt totally stranded.
But wouldn't you know it...
I wasn't trying to do a pun with "barely" there.
It had a Stand that shot something like needles.
I bet if they hit you, they melt your flesh.
The people who live here got hit, but they're still alive.
I can fix them with Shining Diamond.
Huh?
There's one more. I was just attacked by it.
Jotaro! Y-Your hand...
I was hit in the next room.
Getting hit by five or six of those
Thank goodness I dodged!
I'm lucky our personalities are so different.
That rat ran outside afterward.
It must've figured out that you finished off the one in the kitchen.
I hate to ask, but I'm sort of waiting for you to fix me up quickly.
O-Oh, right!
Damn it!

Hello, this is the Speedwagon Foundation research team.
Hello, this is Jotaro Kujo.
Jotaro!
I was in pursuit, so my ringer was off.
Does it have to do with Otoishi?
Yes. Akira Otoishi hid the fact that he had shot two rats.
Let me confirm.
Yes, there's no doubt about it.
Good grief, Akira Otoishi...
Way to go.
It only cares about itself.
It's not a creature that should be allowed to live on this Earth anymore.
Jotaro, wait!
Rats have a habit of not wanting to go down an unfamiliar path.
Which means, without a doubt, it went back
There... Those bite marks are new.
Yes! This is awesome!
We'll be able to corner it!
Take a look at this.
It didn't even glance at the bait in the trap.
It's on the video.
Its ear looks like a leaf that's been eaten on by a bug.
Let's call it "Bug-Eaten" from now on.
Look at how cautious it is...
These are rifle rounds.
Just in case, I brought four rounds.
A-Actual rounds?!
Because of air resistance, when round bearings fly
With the head of this round, we'll be okay up to 70 meters.
Am I going to shoot that with my Stand's hand, too?
I'm not confident about this at all.
Of course not. I guess I'll just have to do it.
Hold on...
Why'd you have to say it like that?
I'm the one who took care of the other one!
Sure, it wasn't a perfect shot, but...
Right. So carry two rounds.
Huh?
S-So much pressure...
Be careful. There are leeches in this puddle.
What?!
Impossible...
What's wrong?
Be careful, Josuke.
What is this?!
I know! It's under the dirt.
No!
Backtracking?
Backtracking is a special instinct that wild animals have
In Japan, it's said that brown bears, weasels, and rabbits do this.
But there's no record of rats backtracking, too.
Does that mean, basically, that the rat put one over on us?
Things aren't looking good.
I feel like something's staring at us.
Move calmly...
Bug-Eaten's Stand's attack isn't too fast for us to see.
Don't miss where it's coming from.
If we can find where it's hiding, we'll shoot it instead.
What the hell is this?!
Wha?!
The rat used the trap that we set for it?
Star Platinum, The World!
Good grief.
Don't panic.
Put a bandage on it.
And I figured out where the rat's hiding.
Halfway up the hill, near those three rocks.
You're amazing! Both the rat and you, Jotaro!
Am I the only loser this time around?
It's 60 meters away.
It doesn't look like it's going to shoot more needles yet.
Stubborn little bastard.
Why are you complimenting the rat?
We need to do something.
Well said, Josuke.
I'll give you all four rounds.
Jotaro? What are you going to do?
I'm going to get closer so it'll shoot the needles.
You're going to find out where it is, Josuke...
And then you're going to attack.
Wh-What?!
You're the only one who can do this.
But Josuke, you can't fix yourself.
Give it all you've got, Josuke!
I-I need time to mentally prepare!
Star Platinum, The World!
Did you find it?
N-No... It moved right after it fired!
I'll try to get closer while going up the side of the hill.
Look for the moment it fires.
The moment it fires...
Th-The pressure!
There! I see it!
What?!
That bastard calculated that I'd dodge
It ricocheted?
Jotaro!
Don't look at me, Josuke!
This isn't good.
If I waste any time...
Here we go, Josuke.
There! It's the same spot as before.
But it's hiding behind the rocks.
Damn it! If only it was looking over here...
But I've got to do this!
I'm just going to have to hit that small target!
I'm suddenly feeling stronger.
Josuke missed...
So you did look.
Now I can target you for sure.
In the end, I wasn't a loser at all.
Call me Josuke Higashikata, the man who deflects pressure!
The Stand rats that Akira Otoishi created...
But thankfully, Josuke's pretty reliable.
Good grief. We can finally relax a little.
Episode 17 Rohan Kishibe's Adventure
Episode 17 ture
You Are Here
Koichi...
Over here, Koichi.
Ah! R-Rohan Kishibe!
Come on, now. You don't have to put up your guard like that.
It's not like I'm going to harm you.
I have a feeling we have a lot in common.
Don't you think so?
Uh...
You see, there's something that I wanted to ask you.
I lived around here from when I was a baby up until I was about four.
I wanted to find the place where I lived then, for nostalgia's sake.
It's also a manga artist's job to remember their childhood.
What I wanted to ask you about is this town map.
Look.
Convenience Store Owson
Kisara Drugstore
Soba Shop Arisugawa
Tailor Tanaka
You Are Here
Huh?
Now look at the actual shops.
From the right, it's Soba Shop Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore, and...
Owson on the left...
Huh?
The road between Owson and the drugstore isn't on the map.
Koichi, will you come with me for a bit?
I'd be very grateful if you'd show me around here.
Huh? Well, I, uh...
Even after I, Rohan Kishibe, have asked so courteously?
I see.
You're so selfish. Jeez...
Just five minutes, okay, Sensei?
Just five minutes!
Rohan Kishibe's Adventure
Isn't it bizarre?
This road isn't on this 1/3000 scale map
Ugh...
Jeez, this map is infuriating.
Look, Koichi.
Yonemori
These houses that say "Yonemori," "Honma," and "Onodera" aren't on it, either.
Honma
Numakura
Onodera
This map is filled with errors.
Rohan-sensei..
Looks like an empty house.
Rocky
What a strange place.
It doesn't look like anyone lives in these four or five houses.
Even the electricity to the vending machine's been cut.
Huh?
That post box...
This is where we first turned.
How strange...
But we turned right, left, then right, so how...
It's possible that we're being attacked by someone's Stand.
Huh? Stand?!
Koichi, would you have Reverb fly up to the sky?
I see!
Reverb Act 1!
What's the matter?
Th-There's something there.
Something touched it up in the sky.
I didn't see anything.
But something definitely touched it!
Are you two lost?
Want me to show you the way?
A girl!
That girl's a Stand user!
Heaven's Door!
Don't even give her a chance to speak!
Boom
Now we're safe.
That's amazing!
I-It looked like a drawing leaped out just now...
I guess that means I've matured a bit.
We're on the same wavelength.
She's not a Stand user. She's just a normal girl.
Huh? Sh-She's not an enemy?
Right. You can't hide anything from Heaven's Door.
She's Reimi Sugimoto, age 16.
She doesn't have a boyfriend. Her measurements are 82-57-84 centimeters.
She has a mole on the side of her left nipple.
She had her first period the September after she turned 11.
The first time she kissed a boy, he forced his tongue into her mouth.
Hey! Hold on a sec, Rohan Kishibe!
All right, all right.
Don't get so angry.
Want me to show you the way?
We'll be fine if you could just tell us which way to go.
No, no. You won't understand if I just explain it to you.
I'll show you the way, so follow me.
Want one?
No?
Could you just grab the other end, then?
Snap
Aw, you're going to get dumped by some girl.
What are you talking about?
It's Pocky fortune-telling. How the Pocky breaks tells me your fortune.
You're selfish, aren't you?
That's why you'll get dumped.
Did you hear that, Koichi? She's completely off!
She called me selfish!
If we're going to play that game, I know a thing or two, as well.
Light pink nail polish means you're a coward when it comes to love.
You let true love slip away at the crucial moment.
Huh?
This is a psychological test, not fortune-telling.
Other than love, there's something else scaring you right now, isn't there?
A murder?!
Murder...
No one lives there now.
Do you want to hear about it?
I heard this from the old lady who lives next door.
she awoke to a "drip, drip" sound coming from her parents' room.
But the girl wasn't that scared, because...
Her beloved dog was by her side.
Beloved dog?
Yes. He was a big guard dog.
She felt safe because Arnold was with her.
But she heard the dripping sound go on for more than ten minutes...
Finally, the girl decided to find out what the sound was.
And then...
His blood was the dripping sound that she heard.
"I already killed your parents." And then...
The girl was killed, too!
I-Is that a true story?!
Did it sound like one? It was just payback for trashing my nail polish.
Whew...
Th-That stuff is bad for my heart... Jeez...
Drip
Wha—
That's...
Yes... That girl was me.
Both Arnold and I are ghosts.
G-Ghosts?
What my Stand, Heaven's Door, read
You two walked into the place where I died fifteen years ago.
I guess we're on the same wavelength.
This is the border between the living world and the next.

Koichi Hirose
Let's get out of here, Koichi!
I-It's no use!
Use Reverb, Koichi!
Have it fly into the air and find the way!
She must have been what touched it in the sky earlier.
Just have it fly up already, Koichi!
Wha—
What?! There's suddenly a wall in the sky!
K-Koichi, Reverb is touching the ground.
Huh?! Ah, what?!
Y-You're the one who went flying up into the air.
There's only one way out of this place.
And I know where it is.
H-How are we supposed to fight a ghost?
Please don't possess us!
Hey, hold on. Stop treating me like a vengeful spirit.
What did I do to you?
You're the ones getting all scared on your own!
I'm not the one who trapped you in here.
This is the border between this world and the next.
You two have strange powers.
I wonder if that's how you ended up here.
You're not our enemy?
You really don't trust people, do you?
I think I'm what they call a bound spirit?
I became a ghost that can't leave here.
But you're the first ones that I've been able to talk to this much.
I told you I'd tell you how to get out of here, and that's what I'm going to do.
After I finish the story, that is.
Story?
The rest of my story from earlier.
The murderer hasn't been caught yet.
He's somewhere in Morioh.
That's what I wanted to tell someone.
Wait. Are you telling us because...
I'm not asking you to catch him.
But I want you to tell someone...
Someone who can catch him, like the police...
Whoa, whoa. Why should we have to do something like that?
Rohan-sensei!
It's fine. I just want to say the rational thing.
I do feel bad that you were killed...
But why should we have to find the murderer just because of
I think, as a ghost, you'd be better off
Do you even know how many boys and girls have disappeared from this town?
Huh? No.
It's eight times the national average.
I'm not saying it's all of them, but at least some of them are being killed in secret.
By him.
W-Wait a second!
Hey! Don't make baseless claims like that!
You just said you didn't see the murderer's face!
So how would you know that?
The souls of the murdered fly above here all the time!
And they all have a wound just like this.
H-How cruel... It's so long and deep...
I know what he's into! I know!
These murders have been going on for
It's frightening, and it wounds my pride.
When they catch the murderer, my beloved Morioh
But we have to stop the murderer as soon as possible!
Even now, he's targeting someone, and I can't do a thing.
Who's going to be killed next?
I don't know if you understand what I'm saying, but...
I'm done talking now.
A-All right. I'm very shocked.
But... Still, we have to do something.
Hmph. Stop being such a goody-two-shoes, Koichi.
It's just going to be trouble.
But it might be good to go after the murderer and interview him.
I might be able to draw a really interesting manga!
Is the exit this way?
If you think he's a good person deep down... well, you shouldn't.
He's pretty gray when it comes to being trustworthy.
Hey, are you listening?
All right. I'll lead you to the exit.
Huh? The exit? Where? Where is it?
If you turn left past the post box, it's right there.
Yay!
Don't rush!
A rule?
What? Why?
It's the rule for passing from this world to the next.
Even Arnold understands that.
Well, I guess we can promise to do something even a dog can handle.
What happens if we turn around?
Our souls will be pulled into the next world, which means you'll die.
Don't be frightened!
R-Right when we passed the post box...
Something shot between our legs and went behind us!
Don't turn around!
R-Rohan-sensei, something is following us.
I know.
Something's there...
Don't worry about it!
N-Now a warm liquid is dripping down my neck...
You're almost there! That light is the exit.
What?
Huh?
Th-The exit...
But I can't take it any longer!
Rohan-sensei, let's run!
Don't panic!
You're safe now.
You got through it.
That was so scary! I'm so relieved!
That was a lie, Koichi!
Huh?
Impossible...
Not yet. Don't look back yet.
They didn't try to trick me!
Koichi!
Hmph. I don't really get it, but we just can't look, right?
You're lucky you're with me, Koichi.
Heaven's Door!
You won't be able to see, and you'll be blown away.
Crash
Boom
Calm down, Koichi.
I'll write that you can see again now.
The road between the convenience store and drugstore is gone.
W-We made it back...
We'll always be here.
Until the murderer's caught.
The day that Arnold and I turn around to go
Until then, I can't leave here.
come by any time.
Rohannie and Koichi...
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
That girl had some nerve, calling me "Rohannie."
She was getting too friendly.
But... Reimi Sugimoto, huh...
She's been fighting for fifteen years, alone, for the sake of the living.
Zero Clues Found in Family Massacre

Sugimoto Reimi
There it is! Sugimoto Reimi, age 16.
Not that I doubted her, but now I've got some clues.
Ah, could you be...
Rohan Kishibe, who became a manga artist?
You know me?
so it's no surprise that you don't remember that incident.
Your house at the time was very near theirs.
The night of that incident, your parents had urgent business
So they left you overnight at the Sugimoto household
That night, Rohan, you were staying overnight at the Sugimoto household.
And you were the only one to survive.
I was... there?
Sugimoto Family Grave
"Reimi snuck me out the window."
Reimi saved you before you could be found by the murderer.
That little girl... No wonder she acted all friendly with me.
I can't read my distant memories nor my fate with my Stand, Heaven's Door.

It will appear between the convenience store, Owson, and Kisara Drugstore at 2-chome. Warning: Most people won't be able to see it, but if you happen to wander down this path, do not turn around, no matter what.
I really met a ghost!
The girl in that picture is Reimi!
Okay, we get it.
She's cute... She's my type.
We should eventually go meet this ghost, too.
"Is the murderer a Stand user?"
W-Well... I don't know...
Then we'll just have to let the police and the courts deal with it.
B-But there's a murderer in Morioh!
I know. And that's why I'm saying that Jotaro and the Speedwagon Foundation
Calm down.
It's not like we'd run into him right away, like we'd hailed a taxi cab.
Let's stay calm and look into this carefully.
So what did Rohan have to say?
The same thing as you, Josuke.
Hey, look out, Koichi.
S-Sorry...
Originally, Morioh was a resort filled with villas that belonged to samurai.
My ancestors were among them.
All that's left is the house that I live in now.
And I'm stuck working a trivial office job.
Hey, what did you do with the imported wristwatch I bought you?
Ah, it's in your bag. That's right.
It was a little too big for you.
What's wrong? Why are you acting so shy?
Now... Watch your step.
Let's enjoy this weekend to the fullest.
Just the two of us.
You just dripped something...
You need to clean that up yourself.
I can't remember what your name was, but that's all right.
Well done. You cleaned it all off.
Now, then...
Let's make dinner together.
What's the dish that you're best at?

And it seems like no one's even realized that these murders are taking place.
It's such shocking and chilling information.
But there is currently no way of finding that murderer.
We don't even know how many Stand users currently live in Morioh.

I was weak!
I can't even remember what I used the money on.
This is all that damn old man's fault!
Because he used my card to buy 130,000 yen worth of baby crap!
but then I felt like spending a little
I wonder if I tucked away a thousand yen somewhere and just forgot about it.
A cockroach!
A S-Stand?
I found one yen.
Y-You bastard!
I-It's a Stand!
A new Stand has appeared!

Where the hell is it heading?
There's another one!
Damn it! Who the hell are you?!
I'll kill you!
Okuyasu!
Oh, Josuke!
Look! It's an enemy Stand. I'm gonna kill it!
There're two of them!
Yeah. There was one at the bank, so I followed it here.
How did it attack you?
Actually, it didn't attack me.
What? It didn't attack you?
But you just said you were going to kill it.
Damn it! Give me back my money!
Found it!
Hey, another one just joined in...
Found it!
Found it. Found it.
What the... What the hell are these guys?
Okuyasu, they're just like your brother Keicho's Stand.
Since they're ignoring us, they're a totally different kind of creepy.
Yeah...
Be careful! The user's probably nearby.
Boom
It's...
It's money!
Come to think of it, it picked up a 1 yen coin
They're only 1 yen and 10 yen coins, but they're all real!
Well done, you guys.
Many a little makes a mickle.
I think that's about five thousand yen.
Hey, that's the user?
Yeah... He seems to have become a Stand user because
Grin!
You guys...
Hey, you can see them, right?!
Yeah, it's called a Stand.
I'm Josuke Higashikata.
Friends! I've never had any before!
My name is Shigekiyo Yangu.
and my Papa and Mama call me "Shigechi."
"Shige-chan" turned into "Shigechi."
My turtle I have at home is named Gonta.
This is a picture of my Mama, who yelled at me.
A picture...
U-Um...
So, you call these things "Harvest"?
Did they really gather up all this?
Yup. From ditches and underneath vending machines and things...
The officer at the police box said that
I hate bad things!
That's not a bad thing at all!
Actually, I think you're doing something great for society.
Really? I'm great?
It's what you'd call a blind spot for ideas.
No one would do all this to get money.
I'm jealous... You're smart.
D-Did you just call me smart?
N-No one's ever told me that before.
I've picked up about 120,000 yen, but...
120,000?!
B-But that makes me even happier!
A t-total of 120,000?!
Aren't I a good boy?
J-Just here in Morioh?
Ayup! I don't go outside of Morioh.
I might get lost and someone might kidnap me.
120,000... And I only have 12 yen.
Okuyasu...
Is something wrong with your left foot?
Whoa, what?!
Do they belong to you, Shigekiyo?
Talk about stingy...
Hey, I'll give you guys half of this.
Huh?!
You're my friends, right? We have the same kind of power.
R-Really?!
Lucky us!
N-No... Wait a sec.
Look, you shouldn't give other people money or things so easily.
Then I'll give it to you in a hard way.
I'll give it all to you. We're friends, right?
Hey, why are you just hardening your expression?
H-Hey...
Let me talk to him alone for a sec, Shigechi.
Hey, Josuke! Stop acting like a goody-two-shoes.
If he says he's going to give it to us, we should just take it, dumbass!
My pride won't let me do that. Not Josuke.
I'll take anything anyone wants to give me other than a virus! Got it?!
Calm down! I totally understand what you're saying!
But...
I'm actually really broke right now, too.
And so I just thought of a nice idea that can make everyone happy.
Huh? An idea to make everyone happy?
Leave it to me.

Hey, Shigekiyo. Can I call you "Shigechi"?
Sure.
Shigechi, we can't take this.
Huh? B-But that's not what I meant!
I believe that friendship is
I was just...
I know. I totally get how you feel.
And so...
Why don't we do a little business and strike up a friendship?
Business?
Yeah. A business using all three of our powers.
Right here?
That's your elbow. No, .
Basically, I think you're at your limit for picking up lost change.
So I have an idea for how we can use your Harvest
Huh?
An idea that'll make us more money than Harvest picking up change?
It's not a bad thing, and it won't cause anyone trouble.
S-So what's the idea?
Give Okuyasu and me half of what we make for the idea fee.
You'll take the other half, Shigechi.
and we can all become happy.
O-Okay! That's fine, but wh-what should I do?
You know what this is, right?

A b-blue stamp!
I think there are a lot of people who
There are these, too.

Now, this is the important part.
At Kame Yu, for example, you can get cash back for these.
Ah, a-are you... I got it, Josuke!
Let's go, you guys!
Rumble
With only one or two, they'd just be scraps of paper...
But if Harvest happened to pick up
the thousands and ten thousands that are thrown away around town...
Found it.
Inside this trash can!
Inside that trash can!
Found it. Found it.
Found it.
Found it. Found it. Found it.
Found it. Found it. Found it.
Th-They just keep piling up one after another!
Wh-What an amazing Stand! That's awesome, Shigechi!
I got complimented again.
We'll fix the ripped pieces of paper with Shining Diamond.
Yes! Do we have tens of thousands now?
No, it's definitely over 100,000 by now.
Yes!
Grab
We're an invincible trio!
But, Josuke, you sure are something.
Well, in this case, everyone's happy, so it's fine.
F-Friendship is great...
O-Okuyasu, J-Josuke, I wonder if it'll be okay.
Calm down, Shigechi. Believe in Josuke.
That's Okuyasu and...
I wonder who that is.
Okuyasu—
Josuke! H-How did it go?
Did they tell you to piss off?
I wasn't able to get cash back at the CD shop or the toy store.
But I can exchange the coupons for about 40,000 yen worth of CDs or video games.
I'm not asking about that!
Were you able to get cash back for the Kame Yu stickers?
Actually, something kind of unexpected happened.
S-Something unexpected?
It unexpectedly turned into 61,500 yen!
Here you go! It's real, Shigechi!
I-It's real!
It's right in front of my eyes! It's like a dream!
That's awesome, Shigechi!
Y-You really think it's amazing?
Hey... P-People don't really compliment me much...
Do you really think I'm amazing?
Hey, have a little more confidence, Shigechi.
This is something that only you can do.
Okuyasu... Josuke...
Straighten.
Hey, girl. I got a fat stack! Wanna go have some fun?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh, yeah. Here, Josuke, Okuyasu. Here's your share, 10,000 yen.
Shigechi, what is this?
We've got friendship, right? We're friends, right?
Yeah, we are.
So that's a token of our friendship.
Hey, wait...
You said okay to us getting half, and you getting the other.
Half of 61,500 yen is 30,750 exactly.
R-Really? Did I say that?
What?
N-N-Not to mention...
I did it all!
I would have eventually thought of it!
Er... No, no... You never would have thought of it with that pea brain of yours!
Hey, stop, Okuyasu. Come here, fall back a sec.
This is just great.
no matter what we say, he's gonna feel like we tricked him.
We should be the adults here and let it be.
We got 10,000 yen out of it, so let's call that good.
I guess if you're okay with it, I won't argue...
But this just pisses me off so much!
Are you sure he's not taking advantage of us?
No, Okuyasu, there's no point in fighting right now.
Oh, so you can make more money?
You smug bastard...
All right, thanks. We'll gladly take this.
Okuyasu.
Are you thirsty?
You're going to buy it for me?
Then drink some.
Ah! Hey! Why are you throwing those away?
They're just worthless junk tickets, like for the year-end lottery.
I told Shigechi to pick them up along with everything else earlier.
You mean the losing New Year's Lottery tickets?
How do you know it's a losing ticket?
No one would throw away a winning ticket, dumbass.
There are lots of people who forget
If this wins, I'm gonna take half of it.
Sure. Half is fine.
But if you win a sheet of stamps, I don't want it.

It's too good to be true, but it's true!
so it would've just gone into the incinerator.

Heck yeah, I do!

Now, I do have one question...
Reception Office
From which vendor did you gentlemen purchase this ticket?
Wh-Which?
Wh-Why do you want to know that?
Oh, it's just a formality.
You stupid little brats.
I'm a very capable bank associate, and I smell something rotten here.
Or perhaps
there's a reason you'd rather not answer that question?
W-Well, of course we bought it in Morioh.
Oh? Well, that's bizarre...
There isn't a single lottery vendor in Morioh.
O-Oh, right...
It must have been when we went to S City.
We bought all kinds of things, so I don't remember that well...
I-I-I-I-I-It was a while back, too...
I just realized something bizarre...
there's a place to write your name and telephone number, and...
Ichiro Morishita
Ichiro Morishita...
The name written here doesn't match any of your names.
N-Name?!
Phone number?!
That was written on the back?!
E-Er...
Well, well, well, well, this is truly bizarre.
This is your lottery ticket, isn't it?
Oh, yeah! Now I remember!
I wrote down my friend's number on that instead of a memo pad!
Oh! Is that so?
Then how about we give Mr. Ichiro Morishita a call?
We can also tell where
If Mr. Ichiro Morishita was the one who purchased this ticket
we'll then have to check this signature, too...
To see who this ticket belongs to.
Depending on the situation, we may have to turn it over to the police.
The police?!
Hello? This is Morishita.
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Budogaoka Bank.
I wanted to inquire if Mr. Ichiro Morishita
Oh, I'm Ichiro Morishita, and yes, I bought one.
Yeah, I'm sure I bought one.
Yes! You stupid little brats!
There's no way God would grant brats like you the winning ticket!
Morishita
So you did! You bought a lottery ticket.
Yeah, I did.
Morishita Ichiro
I'm going to change just part of the signature...
Kinoshita Ichiro
You see, Mr. Kinoshita, your lottery ticket...
Kinoshita? My name's Morishita.
Huh? But it said "Mori"! What? How strange...
Your phone number is 1771-1281, correct, Mr. Kinoshita?
I told you my name's not Kinoshita, you dumbass!
It's Morishita!
Why are you wasting my time with this?
I threw them all away.
P-Pardon me...
J-Just wait, you!
The number you are trying to reach is currently not in use.
Please confirm the number and try again...
A-Are you satisfied?
I-I-I'm terribly sorry for my rudeness.
Yay! It's my money!
I won this five million yen!
Hey, you promised that half of it would be ours, Shigechi!
Did I say that?
You're doing that again?!
Hey, Josuke! Why are you stopping me?!
You're not gonna let him get away with it again, are you?
No... This time, I'm not backing down, either!
There's no way you're getting away with this!
Well said, Josuke!
So now you don't want to split the money, Shigechi?
You realize this amount is way too much for that to fly, don't you?
Here.
This should be enough for you guys.
You didn't really do anything, after all.
I'll take pity on you because you're my friends.
Crush
Why, you—
Hey, Okuyasu!
Give us the money, you dumbass!
You promised us half, so you're going to give us half!
Stop being greedy, you idiot!
You're always so quick to hit. Don't be rash.
When dumbasses don't get what you're saying, this is how you make them understand!
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry Okuyasu suddenly hit you.
But, Shigechi, let's not cause any trouble.
We're gonna hold onto the promissory note for the five million.
let's split it evenly in half, like we discussed.
But, man, he's ridiculous.
I'm done hanging out with him.
I think we should reflect on the fact that we thought about using him
You dummy.
Huh?
I'm not gonna think of it like that.
The only reason he was able to get the five million was because of us.
If it was him alone, he could only get maybe tens of thousands.
But he's getting 2.5 million on his own.
2.5 million!
yes, yes, yes, yes!
Like I'll give it to you.
Like I'll give it to you!
I heard everything, damn it!
I won't give you guys even one yen!
We got that five million because of my Harvest!
You're no match for my Harvest!
You wanna see proof?
I'll show you!
Bastard!
No! The promissory note for the five million!
You're underestimating us, you little punk!
I'll kill you.
Shigechi...
You're gonna kill us, you backstabbing bastard?
You'd better be prepared to die if you're gonna bring out your Stand against us!
W-Wait, Josuke...
What's wrong?
What's this sensation?
M-My legs...
are itching really bad.
Itching? At a time like this?
They itch really bad!
My whole body itches!
Wh-What is this?!
Lift up your pants, Okuyasu! Hurry!
What?!
They're inside my pants!
I-It's no use!
Damn it!
He's running away!
I-I'm starting to get really pissed off.
I've already been super pissed off!
We're not letting you get away, five million!
Now he's totally made enemies of the Okuyasu-Josuke duo!

See? That's what you get, moron!
or like a bucket relay!
What the hell? He's ridiculously fast!
He may be a simpleton, but he's pretty clever.
Are they like his natural instincts?
Crap! We're gonna lose him!
Calm down.
We just need to
have our Stands lift our bodies in the same way he is, and climb up!
I get it!
My five million...
You actually think you can get away from us, Shigechi?
Bring it on!
I'll carefully pop your Harvests, one by one!
My Harvest is amazing.
It'll gather anything!
Even screws holding pipes together.
Even bolts!
If you want to talk about amazing, there's also my Shining Diamond!
Heya.
I'm still super pissed off, but right now, I'm still willing to forgive you.
I'll just hit you two or three times!
Come on, give us the promissory note for the five million, Shigechi.
I told you...
Wh-What?
My hands...
I can't stand! Okuyasu, be careful!
He did something to me!
O-Okuyasu, you too?
You still haven't figured it out?

then injected it into your bodies!
Right into your veins!
Wh-What?!
You bastard!
Th-That bastard... m-might be pretty smart...
Or it might be his natural instincts.
I-I'm gonna murder him!
There's no way we're gonna lose just because we're drunk!
M-My eye!
Josuke, hurry and fix it!
W-Wait, Okuyasu!
You guys had the nerve to
I'll show you what happens when you underestimate me!
D-Damn it!
You have the nerve to get cocky after you're the one who broke your promise?
I'm seriously going to get pissed off!
There's no telling what I'll do then!
Shut your stupid mouth, Josuke!
Your Stands' powers are nothing!
You guys are useless!
Make demands once you have even half of Harvest's power!
Josuke, close your eyes!
Josuke!
Damn, so close!
But it's no use closing your eyes.
Harvest can get anything!
It can rip off your eyelids and pry out your eyeballs!
All right, Shigechi, stop!
Oh? You're apologizing?
Damn it, you little punk!
Oh? Okuyasu, it doesn't seem like Josuke feels that way.
I-I'll give him a talking-to!
Just let us off the hook with this!
This is the 10,000 yen you gave me and the rest of my money.
Let us off the hook with this.
Who's going to fix my eye if Josuke gets killed?
O-Okuyasu...
Oh, yeah! I just remembered!
I felt really bad for you guys, and gave you more than 10,000 yen!
Here, take this, and please forgive us.
I get it, Okuyasu!
you're trying to lure him over with cash to defeat him!
I totally got what you're thinking!
Okuyasu, being honest like that is very favorable with me.
There, there.
Hey, wait a sec.
Okuyasu, you aren't trying to trick me by luring me
Ah! So you are!
Did you really think I'd fall for that?
You really thought I was that stupid?
That's fine, if you don't forgive us.
But it's too late.
I'm going to scrape away space
and make it
teleport!
We got it back.
Got it back?
I'll just easily take it back...
that you have no chance of winning now.
The five million!
What are you doing?!
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!
Stop!
Why would you do that?!
Inconceivable! Inconceivable! Inconceivable! Inconceivable!
That's five million yen!
Basically, just try and injure or kill us.
The only one that can fix this note is my Shining Diamond...
So there's no way you can win.
Oh... I-I see! Conceivable!
And what happens next certifies your loss.
H-Huh? Again, inconceivable! Inconceivable! Inconceivable! Inconceivable!
What are you doing?!
Pick them all up, Harvest!
Looks like you don't realize that
the fact that you're having Harvest go pick them up
So now who's going to protect you from these two drunks right here?
Oh, conceivable...
Smash
We did it.
Now, Shigechi...
Why don't we review something very simple?
and whose Stand is the one that will put them back together?
Who is it?
J-Josuke...
Whack Whack
Josuke? Did you just address me so casually?
M-Mr. Josuke!
That's right, it's Mr. Josuke.
But who was the one who just took back the promissory note from you?
O-Okuyasu...
Mr. Okuyasu!
Well done. That's a good boy.
All right, next, let's do a little calculation.
How should we split the five million?
How would we split it so that no one feels slighted?
H-Half is fine...
In half?
So isn't half a bit off?
That doesn't really add up at all.
Hello?
I-It'd be a third...
Th-That's right...
I-I was wrong.
We all found this lottery ticket.
We wouldn't have gotten it without the three of us.
I...
Let's split it up evenly, so no one is slighted.
m
Yes!
B-Bills!
I-It's five million yen!
Please consider depositing it into our Budogaoka Bank for peace of mind.
Of course!
We finally did it! It's like a dream!
Wait... Splitting it up evenly so no one is slighted, huh?
Huh? This is weird.
then we should split it 500 to 1 and 1.
Don't you think so?
You little bastard!
You're seriously going to argue about this again?
O-One third is fine!
Josuke Higashikata – Money Currently in Possession – 1,666,666 yen
It's a bit unforgivable for first-years in high school to have this much, but...
To be continued!
Episode 20 Yukako Yamagishi Dreams of Cinderella
Episode 20 Yuof Cinderella
Yukako Yamagishi has been depressed lately.
What? There's someone you like?
Yeah! We both like each other!
I went to the Angelo Stone the other day and
Wow, it's that famous now, huh?
What's wrong, Koichi?
If I can just keep Koichi in my heart, that's all I need to be happy.
I thought that once, but it's really hard...
I wish he'd look at me, even just a little.
But I just don't know what I'm supposed to do...
"My makeup will help you encounter love"
Cinderella?
How lucky can I be?
I can't believe such a wonderful guy proposed to me!
Thank you, Dr. Aya! Thank you so much!
Phew...
I guess a woman's youth is better spent
Come in.
"My makeup will help you encounter love."
If you're interested...
Welcome to Salon Cinderella.
Yukako Yamagishi Dreams of Cinderella
Please, come in.
My name is Aya Tsuji.
Phew... I'm the owner of this place and an aesthetician.
I talk like I have low blood pressure, but don't let it bother you.
Phew...
But I'm very motivated by my work.
Phew...
You...
Phew...
I had no idea there was someone so beautiful in Morioh...
Now, please have a seat right over there.
Write your name and address on that form.
I haven't decided that I'll do this yet.
Here's the price listing.
Makeup Menu Makeup to Encounter Love... 1000 yen Makeup to Capture Love... 1500 yen Makeup to Get Proposed to... 2000 yen Makeup to Make Men Submit... 3000 yen Makeup to Marry into Wealth... 5000 yen Makeup to Marry a Celebrity... 7000 yen Facial Menu
"Makeup to marry a celebrity"?
This salon is a bit different from ordinary salons.
I'm an aesthetician who creates faces of happiness.
Physiognomy—that is, the shape of one's face—
High Brows
Double Eyelid
Big, Wide Eyes
Hmm... Too bad.
I'm going to be blunt.
You're trying to charge money for this?
With that face, the more you love a boy, the more he's going to run away.
Am I wrong?
You're wrong.
Oh, no? Very well, then.
In your case...
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is the face that will encounter love.
Wait... This is cosmetic surgery.
You do surgeries?
This is a face we'll create using only makeup and beauty massage.
But it only lasts thirty minutes.
Would you like to try it?
All right. If it's just makeup...
I have nothing to lose, so I guess I can give it a try.
Thank you. Let's get started, then.
Close your eyes.
Make sure you don't open your eyes.
Don't move.
My hands may slip if you do.
Koichi...
This is the makeup that'll help me encounter love?
Will my luck really change just by altering
Koichi?
I-I've been looking for you, Yukako.
Huh? Me?
Yeah... You passed by Rengatei earlier, didn't you?
a-and I sort of got worried...
Worried?
You were worried about me, Koichi?
R-Really?
Yeah...
I can't believe it...
Is this really because of the makeup?
K-Koichi...
Huh?
U-Um... Only if you want to...
Well...
I guess I am a little thirsty...
Huh? Huh?!
I really am lucky.
I get to be near the cute, yet strong, Koichi...
I suddenly want to eat a chocolate parfait.
Does that make me seem girly?
Huh? No! Not at all!
That's what I wanted, too!
This is like a dream...
Physiognomy really does exist!
I'm really on a roll right now.
My luck is really on a roll right now!
I... I can't believe it...
I can feel Koichi-kun's warmth and beating heart.
I'm so happy...
Oh, It's 4 PM! I can't believe it's this late!
H-Huh?!
Ow...
Y-Yukako, I'm sorry!
I'm gonna head home.
K-Koichi!
Why...
Why is it only thirty minutes?!
Hey, lady! Can't you see the light's red?
Shut up!
It's the light's fault for turning red!
Why is it only for thirty minutes?!
Make it longer!
You encountered love, didn't you?
You should be satisfied with that, and come back tomorrow.
All of my other customers have done that.
No! I can't stand luck that only allows me to be with
Phew...
Next, do the one that captures love!
You really don't listen to others, do you?
I said, "do it!"
Phew... Yukako.
Which means you need to have the willingness for such a wonderful encounter to occur.
Are you able to do that?
Willingness? What are you talking about?
Just changing your physiognomy isn't enough to change your luck.
Phew...
I became an aesthetician because I admired the fairy godmother in .
I want to live giving happiness to others, just like her.
You're very beautiful, and I like you.
So I'll do this specially for you.
We're going to have to work on various parts.
Phew...
It's your whole body... The whole body
must be transformed into a body to capture love.
And the willingness you need to do that is this.
It's to maintain your body after I've worked on it.
If you can do this, you'll have the luck to capture love for eternity.
The price is 72,000 yen for 24 hours.
Fine. Do it.
Good... Now, don't move.
Make sure you don't open your eyes.
I knew you weren't a normal aesthetician.
Th-This power...
I see... so they were Stand powers.
But the more I think about it, I don't care.
If you wanted to harm me, you would have already tried.
I trust you. You're my fairy godmother.
You startled me...
Just start already.
What a wonderful girl...
All right. I'll work my magic.
Cinderella is a Stand that transforms the body's image.
This perfectly completes the work on your body to capture love.
Yukako, your body has become invincible when it comes to love.
The pain in my stomach suddenly went away...
Oh, this is Yukako's bag! Whoops!
I have to go back and return it to her!
Koichi.
Y-Yukako...
O-Oh, yeah. Here! This is your bag.
Huh?
And this is mine.
I accidentally took it. Sorry about that!
W-Well, I'll see you later.
W-Wait, Koichi!
Look at me.
Don't you feel something when you look at me?
W-Well... Well...
Well...
Hey! If it isn't Koichi!
Rohan-sensei!
I'm heading to the Kame Yu department store for research.
Come with me.
I was planning on heading home...
It's embarrassing taking pictures in a department store by myself, you know.
So please?
What is this?
You're so needy... Jeez.
Wasn't I supposed to become the invincible heroine?!
What happened to the effectiveness
of your Cinderella's powers?!
Oh, Ko.
No, Koichi's heart definitely belongs to you now.
Oh, Mom. Sis.
But his reasoning is denying you.
That must be it.
Oh, this gentleman is a manga artist?
But don't worry.
Luck will eventually take your side.
Cinderella is absolute.
By the way, it's 4:45. It's almost been thirty minutes.
Make sure you don't forget to apply the lipstick.
Yes, I'm doing it now.
Luck will take my side, huh?
What? You're going to Kame Yu? So are we.
Huh?!
What's with these people?!
There are even more of them!
And now the person I want here the least, his mother, is here!
Luck is on my side, my ass!
I'll kill that salon bitch!
I guess I'll start taking pictures here.
H-Hey, are you using the flash?
This isn't good, Josuke.
H-Hey, Old Man! Head outside!
P-Pardon me!
Move out of the way, please!
Huh?
What's going on?
Ah!
Whoa! Sorry, Koichi!
Y-Yukako..
K-Koichi...
This... is luck.
This is it!
Our hearts are understanding each other.
Koichi's heart is flowing into mine...
This is my all...
And my life is going to change starting now...
Ci
Cin
Cinde
Cindere
Cinderella
Aya
Aya Tsuji
Josuke, Okuyasu...
I... ended up kissing Yukako. Yeah.
Flail
Flail
What did she do to you?!
Calm down! It's not like that...
I just...
It seems I've fallen in love with Yukako.
Huh?
I'm starting to think that her personality isn't so bad...
It makes me feel warm inside.
Is this love?
I'm not really sure...
Hey, Okuyasu, did you hear him?
Even a Stand would be blown to the moon if it heard that.
He and Yukako...
Gush
Hey, hey, hey! You don't have to cry about it!
But, Koichi...
then there shouldn't be a problem.
That's not it, though...
Yukako has refused to see me ever since.
That's the mystery.
She hasn't come to school for two days.
She won't answer the phone...
Y-You mean ever since you guys kissed...
You haven't heard anything?
Not at all.
Hmm... That is very bizarre.
If anything, I admired Yukako for her dedication to love.
But honestly, I don't think you're going to
We really shouldn't get involved...
Y-Yeah...
But if you're in danger, let us know!
Thanks. I'm gonna go now.
Yeah.
But...
Damn Koichi! I can't believe he kissed a girl!
Seriously, it's no reason to cry.
Th-That hair!
Yukako!
W-Wait, Yukako!
U-Um...
You've got the wrong person.
U-Um... You looked just like her from behind, so...
Actually, no, wait!
K-Koichi...
How dare you do this to me, you stupid dumbass?!
My face just keeps falling apart!
Even if I put on makeup, it just falls off!
You asshole woman!
It appears
that you broke your promise.
That's too bad.
I just forgot, that's all!
Wh-What is this? My hands...
They're turning into mush!
Your palm lines and fingerprints are disappearing.
You shouldn't have broken the promise.
That lipstick was to guarantee your luck.
You need a lot of energy to change someone's luck.
And now that has gone away.
It's your own fault for underestimating your luck.
D-Do you want to die?!
Die?
I wanted to be like the fairy godmother
It is truly a shame.
I shouldn't have tried to make your wish come true.
Your face and your palm lines are now gone.
They've been eliminated from this world.
What... did you say?
They've disappeared.
My face... is gone?
What kind of life does someone with missing parts live?
Yukako!
K-Koichi!
N-No, you've got the wrong person.
Dr. Aya, men aren't allowed in here, are they?
It's that personality...
No doubt about it. You're Yukako.
I sort of fell for that personality...
And that lady is a Stand user, right?
And she did something to you...
It's all over.
I can't go on living.
I'll kill you, Aya Tsuji!
I'll kill you!
Calm down.
That's... P-Part of her face went flying!
There we go.
Phew...
So this is Koichi... Phew...
He was able to figure out that you were
All right, Yukako.
Your last chance is to choose one of these.
Choose your own face out of these.
Your palm lines and fingerprints will return naturally, too.
Just like Cinderella's glass slippers, pick the one that's the perfect fit for you.
You should've let me do that to begin with, you dumbass!
I can figure that out easily!
I look at my face in the mirror every day!
that face will never suit you.
I will warn you that your face will become hideous.
And your luck will be forever based on that face.
Y-Yukako...
Choose carefully.
R-Right...
The correct answer is that they're all wrong.
None of the faces there are yours.
If you can figure that out, I'll fix your face.
That is my rule as Fairy Godmother.
Once I start second-guessing, others look like they might be mine, too...
But...
This is it! There's no doubt about it!
I know, because it's my own face!
Are you sure?
N-No... This isn't it.
Wh-Which is it?
I-I really can't tell after all...
What's the matter? Hurry up and choose.
No, I'm not going to choose.
What?
What are you saying?
You want to live your life without a face?
I'm going to have Koichi choose for me.
I can live with that.
B-But that's not...
I don't care.
Please choose, Koichi.
O-Okay...
This is it.
I don't know why, but I have a feeling it's this one.
But if it's not the right face...
That's Reverb, my Stand.
U-Um, use your Stand to hurt Reverb's eyes, and make me blind.
So I think the best solution is for me to not be able to see.
Koichi...
All right, Yukako...
Yes.
L-Look, Koichi!
It fits perfectly!
Koichi!
We did it, Yukako!
It's because you chose my face for me, Koichi!
Who would have thought he'd say
I bent my rules as Fairy Godmother a bit, but I fixed your face for you.
Yukako, it seems that you do, at least, know a good man when you see one.
Salon Cinderella is currently open.
Her makeup will help you encounter love.
Episode 21 Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 1
Episode 21 YoshiQuietly, Part 1
brought to you again today by your neighbor, Kai Harada.
Our first song of the morning is this...
All right, let's eat.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable
 Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 1
Mr. Kira... Um, Mr. Kira?
Mr. Kira, if you're not busy, would you like to have lunch with us?
Sorry, but I'll have to pass.
I need to go deliver these documents.
Goodbye.
Give it up!
He never wants to hang out.
Yoshikage Kira, age 33, single.
He's not a bad guy, but he just doesn't stand out very much.
Hey, what are you so grumpy about?
The new girls at work just invited me to lunch, that's all.
so there's no way I'd go with them.
You heard me decline immediately, didn't you?
Have I ever left you alone? Hm?
Katsu Sandwich
Come on, which one do you want?
Isn't the bread wonderfully soft?
The sandwiches at this shop
They're usually sold out by 1 PM.
You can feel how warm they are, even through the wrapper.
The katsu in the katsu sandwiches are freshly fried, too, and so crispy.
Oh, no.
You naughty girl.
Thank you very much.
Morioh is such a beautiful town...
Could there possibly be another town this wonderful?
It almost feels like we're on a picnic.
She's getting a bit ripe.
I guess it's about time to break up with her...
Time to sever ties.
"Sever ties"...
Maybe I'll go find a new girl, one who's on vacation or something.
Oh, it's just a dog.
Shigechi!
Oyo?
Josuke, Okuyasu!
Hey, perfect timing, Shigechi.
Sorry this is out of the blue, but please lend us some lunch money.
We forgot to bring money.
Huh? What are you talking about?
That money's in the bank.
A thousand yen will cover both of us.
Yeah.
Come on, please?
Hey, that bag... You've got a sandwich from St. Gentlemen!
They actually weren't sold out?
You can't have this! This is my lunch.
Oh, fine. I'll lend you a thousand yen...
That's the spirit!
Thanks!
You're the one who skips out all the time!
Let's see... "June 24th."
Well, anyway, thanks again, Shigechi.
Lent...
Lent
Well, whatever.
I'll just write it in hiragana.
Huh?
M-My sandwich...
Oh, it's right there.
I feel like it's further away than it was before, but whatever.
Th-That's...
Hey, Josuke, Okuyasu, wait!
You need to put your thumbprints on this IOU!
What? That little brat!
Jeez, what a pain.
You know, you cut your thumb with a knife...
Y-You don't need to be so dramatic.
Hey, let's hurry up and go to St. Gentlemen. They're gonna sell out.
This isn't good. If he opens that bag...
She's wearing the ring I bought her.
it'll just be a matter of time before they trace the ring back to me.
I, Yoshikage Kira, have never left a single clue in the last fifteen years.
And I'm not going to let that kid do that for me!
Josuke, let's hurry.
Yeah.
I'll be waiting outside.
What should I do?
The best thing to do is to swipe it without him noticing.
Shigechi!
You're super lucky, damn it.
The St. Gentlemen sandwiches are already sold out! Damn it!
Oh, I see. So they sold out.
Well, that's too bad.
In that case, I guess I wouldn't mind selling you mine for 10,000 yen.
You're such a damn cheapskate.
I guess we don't have a choice. Let's go to Hokaben, Josuke.
Hokaben, huh?
If we get school lunch as usual, it'll be plenty, though.
No way! He's with Yukako Yamagishi, isn't he?
Why do I have to eat lunch with a happy couple?
Hey, there are a lot of drinks in the prep room in my school's gym.
The gym teacher always sneaks coffee and tea from there.
Wanna just go buy lunch and come with me?
What the heck? Are you stealing from the school?
That's pretty cheap.
And I was trying to be nice...
See ya. Oh, and pay me back my thousand yen tomorrow!
Oh, pardon me!
Sorry about that.
He's planning to eat it at school...
They were calling him "Shigechi," right?
There's no doubt he'll open that bag in a matter of minutes...
This is extremely bad.
Now, then... I should be able to eat my lunch in peace here.
Whoops! I almost forgot!
Before I eat my sandwiches, I need to brew my coffee.
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have some coffee before I leave.
You're a lucky boy, Shigechi.
Hey, Josuke! This is it!
It's smaller than I thought...
Wh-What?
Shigechi, you here?
Shigechi!
Oh, hey. It's Okuyasu and Josuke.
We decided we'd have some coffee after all.
Because we got the 500-yen Makunouchi bentos!
Hmph. After calling me greedy and a thief...
You've got some nerve!
Now, now, don't be so stubborn.
People tend to change the way they think over time.
What should I do?
Damn it! And she's only a few dozen centimeters away...
Hey, Shigechi, get me a drink, too.
I'd actually like Japanese tea instead of coffee.
Is there any black tea? Like milk tea?
Blech. Makunouchi with milk tea? That's gross.
Damn it! He's planning to eat his lunch up there.
At this rate, he's going to open the bag in front of them!
Aw, it's soy sauce again.
The katsu here always come with soy sauce.
Huh? You're supposed to eat katsu with soy sauce.
What?! You idiot!
If you used soy sauce, the tonkatsu sauce would lose its namesake!
Who cares about that?
Yes!
Wh-What?
Crap!
What?
Morioh Landmark #7 Bakery "St. Gentlemen"
How to get there: Get off of the bus bound for Morioh Budogaoka High School and walk two minutes. It's a bakery on the Green Road leading from the station. It's popular because of the varieties of bread made there using a stone oven. Customers include students, housewives, and office ladies. Their most popular items are their sandwiches, which always sell out.
Crap!
What?
Hey! What are you doing, Josuke?
Hey! You weren't trying to steal my sandwich, were you?
No! Don't be stupid.
Don't you dare touch it!
You sure are a greedy little guy.
Don't forget, I want milk tea.
I'm just about to make them.
Now!
I did it.
Here you go.
Sweet.
Thanks!
What's with you?
Wh-Where did you put m-my sandwich?
Huh? Oh...
Looks like it's gone.
Yeah.
Stop messing around!
No, we seriously have no idea!
Seriously, we're not messing around.
No joke, we really have no idea.
Y-You jerks... I-I'm really gonna get mad!
We're telling the truth!
You really need to stop.
We'll find out the truth soon enough!
I just need my Harvest to check the room!
You're such a pest! Yeah, go ahead!
We wouldn't steal your stupid sandwich.
What? I can't see what they're doing from in here.
What is that brat trying to do?
Hey!
I know someone's in the prep room!
That's the gym teacher!
Let's get the hell out of here, Shigechi!
B-But my sandwich!
Now's not the time for that!
Hey, come back here!
Damn you, little brats.
I thought it was strange that my tea and coffee
I need to be more careful about locking the door.
I always have to wonder if I'm protected by luck...
I have a feeling that I can live a pretty happy life.
That was close.
I'm so glad you came back to me.
Found it!
Why does someone I don't know have my sandwich?
Why is an adult that I don't know sneaking around my middle school?
Could it be that you're talking to me, little boy?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
This is my sandwich.
No, that bag is mine!
There are reasons why I know!
They're reasons you wouldn't understand, though.
Take it back, Harvest!
Wh-What? What's going on? The bag is being pulled...
Wh-Wha?! Wh-What... My sandwich...
Is this... a r-r-real human hand?
Oh, dear. It seems you've seen it.
It also appears, little boy, that you have the same power I do.
You can see my Harvest?
H-Hey, what's this hand?
Are you by yourself? Your two friends...
Do they have a power similar to yours?
Hey! Don't move!
If you move even a bit, I'm gonna attack!
You're a really creepy guy! Don't come any closer to me!
I get a really creepy, unfamiliar feeling from you!
Don't move! Don't move from there!
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old.
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
After having a glass of warm milk
Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.
I was told there were no issues at my last checkup.
Wh-What are you talking about?!
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.
I take care not to trouble myself
and I know that is what brings me happiness.
Although, if I were to fight, I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Th-That's...
Deadly Queen... is what I've named it.
so I can sleep soundly again tonight.
Episode 22 Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 2
Episode 22 YoshiQuietly, Part 2
Hm...
Deadly Queen... is what I've named it.
so I can sleep soundly again tonight.
I warned you not to move!
Don't underestimate Harvest!
There are this many?
Oh, yeah! It's the one called the "carotid"!
I'm gonna cut it! My Harvest is invincible!
And it looks like your Stand
is the type that has power, but can't go very far.
Looks like its range is about one to two meters, right?
If you want to die, go ahead and try to move.
I see... So individual users have their own unique powers?
Stand? Hmm... Stand, eh?
By the way, my Deadly Queen also has a special power...
He has something... Grab it!
What? It's just a 100-yen coin.
seeing as how you're already as good as done for.
Deadly Queen's special power
is that it can turn anything it touches into a bomb.
Anything...
Even a 100-yen coin.
Throw away that 100-yen coin, Harvest!
Now I can relax and sleep well tonight.

Episode 22 Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 2
Did you know there's a salon that'll grant you love?
Huh? Seriously? That's hilarious.
It's true! I hear it worked for someone in the high school!
Looks like one blast didn't kill him...
Wh-What happened to me? What...
What the...
What the heck happened?!
I told you.
I turned this 100-yen coin into a bomb.
and about a third of your brain got mixed in with the flesh of your face.
Before I deal one more blow to you, I just remembered
there's something that I want to confirm with you.
You called this power a "Stand."
That Josuke and Okuyasu also have Stand powers, don't they?
H-Help me...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You must die.
No one is allowed to know the true identity of one Yoshikage Kira.
But you see, I'd like to know about Stand users.
I'm sure I'd be able to find out
Josuke, Okuyasu...
How many more are in this town?
What are their powers?
I-I don't know...
I'm certain you must know.
I will eliminate your parents, too.
Wha...
M-My mama and papa?
Hurry up and tell me.
If you take too long, someone might show up here.
Just names will do. Come on, hurry it up.
E-Everyone was saying they were looking for a murderer in this town!
A murderer... They meant you!
You killed Reimi Sugimoto, too!
What? Reimi Sugimoto?!
You're still able to use your Stand?
Deadly Queen!
That brat...
He was so torn-up, too.
I-I'm... gonna go to Josuke...
Josuke's Shining Diamond...
can fix me...
I'm... going to protect Mama and Papa...
I'm gonna protect Mama and Papa from him!
That nasty, filthy guy
can't live in the same town as Mama and Papa!
I have to go...
to Josuke...
Oh, sorry.
Are you okay?
I have to go...
You don't look so good.
He's from the middle school.
Th-There's something wrong with him.
We should get a teacher...
No, just leave him alone. He's creepy.
Let's go.
J-Josuke!
J-Josuke!
You said everyone was looking for me?
Do you mean there's someone in this town
But no one will be able to pursue me...
No one knows the identity of Yoshikage Kira.
As long as you are out of the picture...
I'm gonna protect my Mama and Papa...
Deadly Queen has already touched the doorknob.
Josuke!
This is Deadly Queen's power.
He's been eliminated without a trace.
Did someone call my name just now?
Yeah, I heard it, too.
H-Hey, Josuke, look!
I... found... you!
Sh-Shigechi?!
Shigechi!
S-Something's not right, Josuke!
Harvest was gushing blood when it disappeared.
Why did just one of them show up in front of us?
Let's go to the middle school.
Oh, dear. Where did that fall off?
Well, I guess I can't help it now.
I hope my usual tailor has the same button...
How horrible...
It happened again. It's him again...
Another soul killed by him is flying away...
He must have encountered him.
Shigechi...
There's no doubt about it.
Shigekiyo encountered him, and was killed by him.
I can tell.
or how he was killed.
But it was definitely him.
I can tell it was him because he killed me.
I looked for Shigechi everywhere, but couldn't find him.
He disappeared within just five minutes
and his parents have requested a police search.
That probably means...
Y-You're saying... The culprit is a Stand user?
but I can't imagine there's anyone who can beat Shigechi's Harvest.
Josuke.
I heard you picked up a button.
Yeah... One of the Harvests brought it to me.
This is it.
This is Shigechi's final message.
It could be that Harvest ripped it off of the murderer's clothes and brought it to you.
Let me hold on to this button.
Y-You can locate the guy with the kind of button you could find anywhere?
It's possible.
We might be able to figure out the brand of the clothes and where it came from.
I see...
I-If we're done talking, I'm gonna go home.
I-I'm kind of in a weird mood.
I-I'm really annoyed...
Let's go home, Dad.
There's something wrong with Okuyasu.
but he was the type you just couldn't leave alone.
We can't believe he's gone.
Not to mention, he must feel annoyed because he can't tell
We both feel that way.
I'm sure Okuyasu feels it far more.
Damn it...
It appears something awful has happened outside my notice.
I'm going to warn all the customers who come to my restaurant.
Phew... I don't think he'll come to my place, but just in case...
Stand users eventually attract other Stand users...
Though I never want to meet that guy.
So now everyone's going to take action, huh?
Oh?
That was Josuke just now...
And Okuyasu was there, too.
Hey, listen to this.
Last Friday was my birthday, right?
The guy I'm seeing gave me this super lame ring as a present.
Look at it! Why would I want this thing?
Though I still put on an act like, "Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy!"
This really is a kiddie ring. How much was it?
Probably around 150,000 yen.
I'm gonna go pawn it off for some money.
It doesn't compliment my beautiful fingers at all.
If she comes to me, she can date me with a cleansed soul.
Oh, I have to go. See you later.
Okay, bye-bye!
I'm afraid we'll have to part ways now.

Yoshikage Kira
brought to you again today by your neighbor, Kai Harada.
How is the beginning of the new week treating you so far?
Already, there are only three days left in June.
Now, let's eat.
And once it's July... That's right, it's vacation season.
Oh, yes.
What plans do you all have?
I can't wait.
And now, the perfect song for this sunny day
Let's eat dinner together when I get back.
in the middle of the rainy season. Here you go.
Thank goodness they still had the Parisian special.
Talk about lucky!
Let's hurry up and go to Yohee Lake.
Wait, Asuka's not here yet.
What? What's taking her so long?
It's been four days since Shigechi's incident...
Nothing has really happened since, but...
There's no doubt that there's a killer somewhere in this town.
yet anyone can also look completely innocent.
Ah... H-Hello, Jotaro.
Um, did you find anything out since last time?
Like, about the murderer's button, or...
No, not really.
I-I see...
Um, where are you going?
Nowhere, really.
Just over there.
Ah...
Oh, man... He doesn't really talk, so it's hard to have a conversation with him.
Rohan-sensei is scary because he's so overbearing, but Jotaro's silence is scary, too.
Isn't there something we can talk about? Um...
That's a very lovely coat!
Centipede Shoes
This store appears to be a shoe store.
Huh? Oh! Yes, it's a shoe store.
Is there something wrong?
We also do simple tailoring
It's a shoe store, but they also do things
There's also an electronics shop that sells flowers.
Is there something wrong?
Something wrong with this button?
No, if you haven't seen it before, don't worry about it.
I just couldn't remember what it was originally attached to.
Little boy, would you like an animal cracker?
Animal Crackers
I always eat the camel last, so you can have any of the others.
No, thank you.
Oh, okay.
but look, I just finished repairing the suit it came off of.
asking me to put on the exact same button.
See? It's the exact same button.
Jotaro!
Good grief. We found it, Koichi.
Found it?
Oh, n-nothing...
M-More importantly, what did the customer look like?
His name?
Well, of course I do. What do you take me for?
I remember all of my customers' names.
even if you have hundreds or thousands!
Really?
Yes! That's amazing! Could you tell us his name?
Anyway, the jacket has an order tag on it.
Of course I remember it... Even out of hundreds.
But I figure it might be faster to look.
Let's see...
Kira
The last name is... How do you read this?
I think it's...
Wh-What is it? M-May I see it?
Um... Um...
Look over here.
Wh-What the?! My hand!
Look over here.
J-Jotaro! L-Look!
Watch out, Koichi! Don't go any closer!
Hey, I told you to look over here.
Is that his Stand?!
J-Jotaro!
H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!
To think someone would actually investigate the button that fell off my jacket...
Did they see my name?
Why do things like this keep happening to me lately?
Good grief.
But I will make them disappear
Just like that brat Shigechi...
It's still moving!
Wait!
Don't run after it without thinking.
The way that jacket is being pulled is suspicious.
Something about that Stand...
is dangerous!

J-Jotaro! L-Look!
Watch out, Koichi! Don't go any closer!
Hey, I told you to look over here.
Is that his Stand?!
J-Jotaro!
H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!
Good grief.
Who would've thought he'd come to get his suit now?
The jacket is evidence!
Wait!
Don't run after it without thinking.
Something about that Stand...
is dangerous!
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Heart Attack, Part 1
Centipede Shoes
It's a bomb... It's a bomb Stand!
So this is how it got Shigechi?
That's why we couldn't find him, no matter where we looked.
He's... He's getting away!
Don't go after him, Koichi.
Huh? Don't go after him?
What are you saying?
We need to cautiously observe and act, Koichi.
Wh-What are you talking about?
We just happened to miss the name tag on that jacket.
He's an office employee, and not married.
He's between the ages of 25 and 35, and he looks pretty rich.
Judging from the material and design, that jacket was a high-end brand.
I-I see...
It's not that I don't want to pursue him, but we can't.
Huh?! The Stand?
Y-You saw it?
I didn't see it, but it must be there.
It "must be"? Hang on.
then he never could've kept getting away with killing for fifteen years.
He's someone who gets rid of all evidence.
Which means he plans to get rid of us.
Hold on a sec... Aren't you being too cautious?
Listen up, Koichi.
Look
Carefully
It doesn't mean to just listen, but to listen well.
Listen
 Well
we're going to die.
H-He's sounding high-and-mighty, but my Reverb isn't useless.
I wonder if the bomb Stand is really still around.
Look over here.
I-It's really here!
I-If I keep touching it, it'll explode!
Star Platinum!
After all those hits I landed... This thing's pretty hard.
It's going to explode!
Star Platinum! The World!
I hate doing anything that's tiring, so I'm going to destroy you now.
Y-Yes! You must have stopped time.
Now no matter how much we touch it, it won't explode!
I will make sure the people searching for me
die in an explosion.
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack always gets its prey, no matter what.
I-Impossible! It wasn't destroyed by Star Platinum's power!
A-A Stand that's this hard... Impossible!
Stay back, Koichi.
It's still perfectly fine! It hasn't slowed down at all!
Get back, Koichi!
Get further back, Koichi!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
What are you doing?!
Look over here.
Good grief. I've never met such a sturdy Stand.
I think my confidence is going to break first.
J-Jotaro, at this rate, it's going to blow us up!
You need to get further away.
I-I'd like to say something.
A Stand controlled from far away
But that thing's power and explosive attacks...
The power behind those explosions wouldn't be possible if the user wasn't nearby.
The user should be within fifteen... no, ten meters of here!
And?
"And"?! It's ten meters!
I told you, Koichi. Don't go after him.
You just need to think about protecting yourself with your Reverb.
Don't do anything else.
Wh-Why?!
The culprit is no longer nearby.
I've had many encounters with various Stands, so I know.
Look over here.
Its actions are too simple for it to be controlled from nearby.
You know from experience?
There's no way a Stand that powerful can be controlled from far away.
The user has to be close by!
So Jotaro really is underestimating me.
I've grown, too!
Distance, ten meters.
H-He's there! That's him! He has the jacket!
But something's weird... H-He's too far away.
He's more than fifty meters away...
And he's only getting further away.
Th-The bomb Stand is being controlled from far away?
Having that power and being that far away is inconceivable!
Look over here!
Wh-What? It's heading toward me?!
I figured it out.
That's why it's so powerful, despite being controlled from far away.
Bring out Reverb and protect yourself!
C-Crap!
Reverb is...
fifty meters away, where the culprit is!
I'm sorry!
Good grief.
Star Platinum! The World!
The reason this thing attacked the shop owner first
And it targeted Koichi because
If there's something hotter, it should go toward that.
Time has begun to move again.
I was right.
I'm saved...
then when it's near fire...
This power...

How could this happen? This is all my fault, Jotaro!
This happened because I went after the culprit.
If he hadn't caused the fire for my sake, it wouldn't have gotten him!
Wake up, Jotaro!
Jotaro! Jotaro!
That explosion wasn't a human!
Look over here.
It's going to deal the final blow!
It's too strong!
It's just like Jotaro said!
Look over here.
I have to take this chance to run!
He'll fix Jotaro!
I have to call him!
This is... the kitchen!
There's plenty of heat here!
I need to buy some time and run out that door.
There's a phone!
W-Wait a sec! It's not a gas stove!
It's going to take some time to warm up!
Wh-What should I...
I know! There should be some hot water.
Go over there!
It's empty!
Look over here.
Wait. If I observe carefully, like Jotaro said...
A weakness I didn't notice earlier!
And I'm starting to get pissed off.
Why do I have to regretfully run away
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
Why do I have to think that I'd rather
Isn't something wrong?
The one who should be running away in fear...
is you, murderer!
It always attacks based on temperature...
But that's exactly what your weakness is!
The fact that you never give up on that is your weakness!
It's been almost three minutes.
but there's one thing I can say with more faith than anything in this world.
Heart Attack has no weaknesses.
It'll track down its target, no matter what.
Now, then... Since that's over with, I have to call Josuke on the phone.
He should be home now...
Sizzle
Now that thing's lost track of us.
Keep chasing after the word "sizzle" forever...
Just like a donkey chasing after a carrot hanging in front of its face.
That's what your weakness is.
Hello, Higashikata residence.
Josuke, this is Koichi! There's trouble!
Jotaro is hurt bad, and it's my fault. Please hurry and get here!
What?! Don't say that so suddenly!
Just hurry up and get over here. It finally happened!
We encountered the murderer!
I've captured his Stand here.
What did you capture?!
Wh-What's happening?
Ow, hot! I turned it off, but now it's getting hotter and hotter.
What's with this piece of crap?
How can you cook anything good with this?!
Hey! I'm asking you where you are, Koichi!
Look over here.
Crap! It's ignoring the letters and coming this way!
Koichi, where are you? Hurry up and tell me, you dumbass!
I'm at Centipede Shoes! Hurry!
Crap, Reverb's tail letters also...
Reverb's tail letters got destroyed!
That explosion wasn't a human.
Look over here.
A-Again! It's coming after me again.
But I can't use the tail letters anymore.
Wh-What am I going to do?
Reverb Act 2!
What's wrong, Reverb Act 2?!
Act 2!
Where are you, Act 2?! Why won't you come?!
Act 2 was killed in the explosion!
It's split in two!
N-No, wait...
If the explosion killed it, I'd be dead too, because I'm the user.
N-Now I remember! It looked like Reverb died once before, too.
A-And then...
C-Could it be...
Boooom
Reverb Act 3!
Um, is that who you are, sir?
Please give me orders.
D-Does this mean I've grown?!
You're amazing, Act 3!
Please give me orders.
Er, I don't know what your powers are, so... F-For now...
Please protect us, Act 3!
Um, protect us, please. You can do that, right?
Understood.
Dn

Th-This Stand has incredible speed!
It has way more speed than Act 1 and Act 2!

H-Hey, Act 3?!
It's too strong. I can't.
You can't?!
This enemy has a seriously heavy power.
S-H-I-T.
I pushed, but I lost.
You pushed and lost? You can't be serious!
I'm telling you to protect us!
just like you ordered.
Look over here.
You finished?! In what way?!
You're completely useless! We haven't grown at all!
Look over he—
Wh-What?
This is taking far too long.
Why is Heart Attack taking so long?
Wh-What's going on? My left hand just...
My left hand that released Heart Attack just suddenly...
Sir, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Oh, it's nothing. Allow me to pay for the cup.
I'll be leaving, so can I get my check?
Th-This is...
M-My left hand... is heavy!
S-Sir?
I-Impossible! My left hand! My left hand...
It feels like there's a 40 or 50 kilogram weight on it.
What's going on over there?
Sir, are you all right?
D-Don't mind me.
Please, allow me to give you a hand.
It's heavy!
What are you doing, sir? How could you?
It's sunken into the pavement and having a hard time moving...
Act 3! What did you do? This power...
3 Freeze!
I've rhymed "three" and "free."
Act 3, what is this power?
There's really nothing to explain about it.
It's heavy...
This isn't good. I need to retrieve it.
I have to go retrieve Heart Attack myself.
Episode 24 Heart Attack, Part 2
Episode 24 ttack, Part 2
Doing things that bring attention to myself...
That is what I, Yoshikage Kira, hate the most.
And to think that I'm experiencing this humiliation in front of total strangers...
To think that the invincible auto-pilot Heart Attack would get caught...
Damn... I have to undo this spell somehow...
Hey, mister. You okay?
You sick or something?
Want me to call your mommy?
It's nothing. Get lost.
Hey, hey, hey, did you hear that?
You seeing some sweet dreams during the day after drinking too much, mister?
Is it fun? Does it feel good?
Grasp
That's a nice suit you've got on.
We've been fired and don't have any money.
Seeing guys like you piss me off.
At least try to defend yourself.
Hey, mister. Your shoelaces are untied.
A square knot! That's super nice of you!
H-Hey, what's wrong?

It turns anything it touches into a bomb.
Th-The doctor! Call the doctor!
What a terrible day.
Get me a doctor!

Hey, Josuke.
What the heck happened at Centipede Shoes?
I don't really know, but it wasn't good.
Hurry! It'll take about five minutes.
There are cracks in it.
Please don't go too far away from me.
Act 3's is five meters.
We're even more powerful now.
It can't be helped that my range is shorter than Act 2's.
Gravity
5 Meters
the heavier I can make it.
What would you like to do?
N-No... This distance is plenty.
Apparently, a gym will be opening near Budogaoka High School soon.
I was really considering getting a membership.
I have to gain more stamina.
But I wonder if I'll be lifting the same dumbbells
It took me three minutes to get here.
I felt my lack of stamina the most when I tried to cross at the crosswalk.
By the way, who's going to show up here?
You called someone for help, didn't you?
Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu Nijimura live the closest.
It'll take them about five minutes, so two minutes to go?
You're their friend, aren't you?
H-H...
Yukako Yamagishi and the woman
You wouldn't actually call a lady for help, would you?
H-He's...
I left my jacket with the button behind.
I'll go get it later...
After I'm done with you.
H-He's... right in front of me!
This man...
The one who killed all those people over all those years...
And Reimi and Shigechi...
Let him have it, Act 3!
Dogyuun
Deadly Queen!
Why does he have two Stands?
I thought a user could only have one Stand!
Heart Attack is a tracer bomb that was launched from Deadly Queen's left hand.
That's why the damage is only in my left hand.
Warning, Sir Koichi.
The bomb Stand's weight will disappear.
S-h-i-t. I'll have to attack it with 3 Freeze again.
I see... Range, eh?
Who would you like me to hit?
3 Freeze cannot make two things heavy at once.
Even if we make the bomb heavier, the user will come after me.
Which will it be?
Which one are you going to attack?
S-Stop the bomb!
3 Freeze!
Ker-bam-bam
It appears that, no matter who you attacked, you were still fated to lose.
would be completely useless...
This is the first time
I've ever felt so cornered.
I even feel a slight sense of defeat.
Goodness. I must show you some respect.
By the way, do you have any pocket tissues?
A handkerchief would work, too.
Hm? I've shown you some respect.
I don't... have any.
Then, here. Use mine.
A lot of blood is coming from your nose, right?
It's just so you can wipe that off.
I'm about to beat you to death.
I have a little over a minute before your friends get here.
Otherwise, I just won't be satisfied after having to face such humiliation in public.
Now, now, stop screaming in such a weird way.
I endured the same pain you feel now
You're a boy, aren't you?
You should take after me.
See? You need some tissues now, don't you?
I'll wipe it for you.
But you know, I was on the ground a little while ago, too, just like you.
I'll blow you away with Deadly Queen in another minute.
Until then, you need to be like me and just endure the pain.
You need to be like me!
Y-Your name...
is Yoshikage Kira...
Yoshikage Kira is your real name...
My driver's license!
When did you take it out of my wallet?
You little brat...
You said you paid some expenses at the café earlier, right?
That's when I had an idea.
So what?
You're about to be erased.
Yeah, you're about to kill me.
But even I was able to figure out your name.
You're not that big a deal.
You might get away for now, but how do you feel?
A little brat like me managed to find out what your name was.
I'll say it again.
You're a complete idiot!
You bastard!
Damn it! What is this sense of defeat?!

He's got his socks on inside-out.
Ugh, it sure bugs me!
Not that way, Okuyasu!
But Centipede Shoes is this way.
If we go this way, we'll get there in a minute! Hurry up!
Wear them properly.
Now I can finally relax.
And now I can blow you to kingdom come!
Deadly Queen!
The tip of this finger can turn anything into a bomb.
I guess, in your case, I'll make your student badge a bomb.
The first bomb!
Koichi, you were winning against that man psychologically.
What?!
Well, this is a surprise.
However, you would have been much better off if you had stayed down.
I can almost see the view behind you through your wounds.
That's a nice watch.
But I'll break it so you can never see the time on it again...
By that, I mean I'll break your face.
You seem like quite an interesting fellow.
but I must take my leave.
I only have twenty seconds left.
I don't have time for idle chit-chat.
Your Stand just now was very weak.
I was easily able to catch it, like a pop-up.
Do you really think you can defeat my Deadly Queen with so little power?
Smash
Wh—
H-He's fast...
Wh-What's with this speed?
Upon closer inspection... Good grief, what an ugly watch.
But you won't have to worry about that anymore...
Because your face is going to end up
What is this Stand?
It's so fast, it's like it stopped time!
Koichi, if it weren't for you, I would have been dead.
You did well fighting all by yourself.
You have my respect, Koichi.
You've matured.
Hey, Koichi!
Koichi!
Wh-What the heck happened here?
K-Koichi! Jotaro!
Be careful, Okuyasu.
What the heck happened?! Jotaro! Koichi!
Calm down. I need to find out if Koichi is alive or not.
If he's alive, I can fix his wounds with Shining Diamond.
Yes! Jotaro is alive! Just barely, though.
K-Koichi's alive, too. But he's not breathing!
Hurry! Hurry up and fix him, Josuke!
Hey, he's not waking up at all!
But I've already fixed him up.
This is awful... Josuke and Okuyasu are here.
He's hurt really bad!
It's gonna take a while for him to regain consciousness.
What a day... I've never had such an awful day in my life.
I have always been able to get through any dilemma...
I'm going to get away, no matter what.
What are you doing?
Hey, he's awake.
Hey, don't try anything funny.
Turn this way slowly. Show us your face!
Be careful! Don't go to Centipede Shoes!
There's going to be some crazy explosion!
The owner just suddenly came flying out!
Those two, too!
An explosion?
H-Hey, calm down. Were you caught in the blast?
I'm just an office employee.
But now I'm going to die... Look at all this blood.
H-Hey, calm down. It's all right now.
I'll patch you up.
Where did you get hurt?
I think one of my ribs might have punctured my lung.
H-Hurry up and fix me, please!
Hurry?
You totally fell for it.
Crap... I got too impatient.
Which means you're the enemy.
This was a draw.
Th-This guy's the murderer?!
I guess this means I've lost.
Yes, the one you're all looking for is me.
It appears I won't be able to sleep peacefully anymore...
But only tonight!
Deadly Queen!
What the hell are you doing?!
Exactly what it looks like. I cut it off.
I-It hurts... It's so painful, and I'm bleeding a lot.
But winning or losing means nothing to me.
I'm going to survive.
but I will live happily!
Heart Attack, you are free!
I leave the rest to you.
Protect me.
What the hell is that wimpy-looking thing?
Josuke, that's a bomb Stand that goes after body heat!
And it won't break!
It's going to explode in reaction to your body temperature!
It won't break?
Break?
You've got it backwards. I fixed it.
If that guy left it behind...
This is a pretty gross idea, but that hand is heading toward the murderer.
Let's go after it!
You're not getting away that easily, dumbass!
H-Hey, look at that...
Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully...
K-Kira? Why is your face all bloody?
Hello, everyone. Is it already time to head home?
I'm in a hurry, so I'll be seeing you.
The murderer's name is Yoshikage Kira.
His address is Morioh Kotodai 1-128.
He's 33 years old.
His Stand is a short-ranged bomb Stand, Deadly Queen!
Hey, where is that guy headed?
It doesn't matter where he's headed. He's finished!
He's in this building.
Hey, wait... This is...
Salon Cinderella!
What's he doing here?!
A-Aya! Are you here?
Dr. Aya Tsuji!
A-Aya's...
What is this? What the hell is this?!
He's dead... Why is Yoshikage Kira dead?
Aya!
Th-This is...
What the hell happened?
Wait! That man isn't Yoshikage Kira! He has his left hand!
Huh?
He d-doesn't have a face!
What?!
He's missing his fingerprints on his right hand, too. Who is this guy?
Guy...
He's wearing the same suit...
He brought in that guy, and killed him in front of me.
He's too terrifying...
He made me switch his face using Cinderella.
And his hair and fingerprints, by force...
So he's someone else now?
Yes...
H-His face...
Shining Diamond!
H-His...
Josuke, don't touch her! Get away from there!
His face...
Aya!
On the other side of that door!
You're not getting away, damn it!
Th-This is...
I-It's time for everyone to go home...
S-So many...
Wh-Which one is he? Which one is Yoshikage Kira?!
Yoshikage Kira, you coward! Show yourself!
He managed to get away.
He's not going to be quivering, or hiding.
He's not even going to leave Morioh.
He's going to live his life in this town, like he always has.
Aya Tsuji: dead.

Episode 25 Heart Father
Episode 25 Hearher
I met that boring man
when I was going to community college.
so I went out with him to feel superior.
We had a child.
I see. Because it's three times the speed, the picture quality's...
Hey, Hayato. No "hello" for your mother?
Hi.
My husband's not a bad man.
he always goes to work.
Kosaku Kawajiri Shinobu Hayato
But...
I'm a woman who married without ever knowing love.
Hmph. He's home.
He only knows the words "food," "bath," and "sleep."
That boring man...
I'm home.
Where's dinner?
Oh, you're home? I didn't even notice.
I was really busy today, so that's all there is.
But it's your favorite, isn't it?
Ramen Land
Is he mad?
If you have the guts to get mad, then get mad.
I'm sure you're just going to eat your dinner silently as usual, though.
brought to you again today by your neighbor, Kai Harada.
What are you doing?
How's your evening going so far?
 Heart Father
Fifteen minutes by car from Morioh Station...
His house was in the villa and resort area.
Morioh Station
Yoshikage Kira's House
Rather, it was Yoshikage Kira's house when that was still who he was.
Kira
I'm sure he'll never try to come near here again.
There aren't any corpses in the fridge, are there?
But we had to search the place.
the only clues we could possibly find on him would be in this house.
Is that his album?
Third Grade Summer Summer Camp 7-25-1974
Yoshikage Kira...
Born in Morioh Town on January 30th, 1966.
He was born to parents of advanced age.
and his mother died of old age not long after.
In 1988, he graduated from D Academy's Department of Literature.
That same year, he started working for S City's Kame Yu department store.
He transferred to the Morioh branch in 1993.
No previous criminal record. No record of getting married. No close friends.
No girlfriend. No surgeries.
It's impossible to find him using fingerprints, teeth, or surgery scars.
That's all rather vague information.
Look. These trophies and awards...
High School Music Recital Violin 3rd Place Yoshikage Kira
They're all third place.
Middle School Track Meet 200 Meter Hurdles 3rd Place Yoshikage Kira
Award Grade School Writing Contest Overall 3rd Place
And it's hard to tell what he was good at.
Even in this photo, he's positioned so he doesn't stand out.
No one envied him or ridiculed him...
He's a man who doesn't show his strengths or weaknesses to anyone.
Which means...
Of course, all this was deliberate.
He knew that was the best way to stay out of trouble.
I came here hoping we could possibly find one of his hobbies, but...
See?
It looks like some sort of scrapings in them.
And what are these numbers?
"1983"... Maybe it's the year.
They have a faint smell. What do you think they are?
They appear to be nail clippings.
Huh?
Wh-Whose nails are they?!
Th-They couldn't be...
No, they're his own nails. They're not from his victims.
He's kept very meticulous data in his notebook.
Data? You mean the numbers on the jars?
Does that mean he's been collecting them since 1983?
For the last fifteen years?
Thumb | Index Finger | Middle Finger | Ring Finger | Pinky
Gah! He recorded every finger! He's so detailed!
[Years that my nails grew more than 30cm] Right Hand Measurements
Does this mean that in 1983, his thumbnail on
1983 was the year Reimi Sugimoto was killed.
The records begin in that year.
He probably reached the point
Whoa! He's got his toenail lengths on the next page!
I guess we've discovered the odd hobby
Look.
No one can stop me.
This data is fortune-telling.
It appears Yoshikage Kira used the length of his nails
Whether he was in condition to kill, of course.
1999!
He's insane, that sick bastard!
But this isn't a clue we can use to track him.
Does this mean someone else is in this house?
It would appear so. Josuke, stay on your toes.
Does that mean he's working with someone else?
No... That's not possible.
Crimes can be traced from interactions with others.
A partner could possibly rat him out.
He's not the type to trust anyone.
This is...
Jotaro, look at that camera.
I-It's his father... Kira's father!
He's in the picture, right behind us!
But...
This is not good. This is so not good.
Does that mean he's a ghost?
it's possible that his father also couldn't pass on
Look at his expression.
He looks like he wants us to get the hell out.
Number Withheld Public
Are you trying to scare us with your ghost energy?
But this is all the more reason we can't leave.
Hurry up and answer the phone, you slowpoke!
I'm making it ring!
You think I look like I want you to leave?
It's the opposite, you moron!
My face is saying that I'm never letting you leave this house!
Anyone who goes after my son must die.
You bastard! You know about your son's crimes?
Hey, is something wrong? What's all the racket?
Where are you hiding?
Ghost?!
Josuke, he's not hiding.
Huh?
It appears Kira's father has been present from the start.
Look.
Boom
Wha... When did he...
He's moving around in the picture.
He probably threw the receiver from within this picture, too.
I'll kill you...
I'll kill anyone who goes after my precious son!
Josuke!
We can attack ghosts with our Stands!
Rohan-sensei used his Heaven's Door to read Reimi's memories!
Bastard!
Take this!
What?!
D-Damn!
Hurry up and fix it, Josuke!
Josuke! Jotaro!
That power... I see!
Okuyasu, you're up!
Use The Hand to cut just the old man out of the picture!
Gotcha! Leave it to me, Josuke!
Huh?
O-Okuyasu?
Wh-What the?!
Why did I run straight into the window?
M-My hands are coming out all the way over there!
I can't come past this point!
That's...
A-A wall!
It won't break! I-It can't be!
You finally figured it out?
It may look like you're in the room, but you're actually not.
I'm a ghost that lives within a photograph...
I can control the dimension of any photograph that I appear in.
Because I can trap the energy of others' souls in photos, using the camera!
That is my power!
Inside the picture? But it's right in front of me!
If you're as dumb as you look, you don't need to think about it too hard.
After I kill these two, I'll trap the two of you and slice you up!
J-Josuke! Jotaro!
I'll kill you...
You bastard! Stop, damn it!
Jotaro, what are you doing?
Do something with your invincible Star Platinum!
Josuke... I'm giving up.
Huh?
It appears impossible to stop the old geezer's attacks.
then even if I stop time with Star Platinum, we won't be able to do anything.
When something's useless, I give up.
What did you say, Jotaro?
What the hell are you talking about?!
I'll kill you!
Your heads went flying!
A-A knife...
What?!
I can't touch it! J-Jotaro!
but...
Wha?
then maybe all we have to do is take a picture of him by himself, so he's alone.
What?!
To think you've evaded my attack... Damn it!
Josuke, say something to him.
Y-You didn't scare me at all, you idiot!
The
The Ha
The Han
The Hand
Oku
Okuyasu
Okuyasu Niji
Okuyasu Nijimura
Damn you!
You guys are clearly used to fighting.
You must have fought against people with the same kind
He can get out, since he's a ghost.
We need to make sure you stay in there and keep quiet.
There's something in this house that will cause him a lot of trouble if we find it.
That's why you attacked us.
I get it.
Okuyasu, Koichi, you two search this room.
I can't protect my son now! Damn it!
If that falls into their hands...
Still, what thing that might cause trouble for him should we look for?
I'm not thinking too much about it.
If Kira's old man there turns pale, it's a good sign.
I-I can't breathe...
I-It's too cramped... Please, just a little is fine.
Just open the tiniest of holes in the tape and let me breathe...
Y-You really can't breathe?
Hey, Koichi, he's just acting.
He's trying to get you to open a hole so he can escape.
Y-You may not believe me, b-but I really can't breathe!
I'm claustrophobic, so I understand how that feels...
Oh, quit whining. You want us to open up a hole that bad?
Fine, then. I'll open up plenty for you...
With tacks, that is.
Wh-What are you doing?!
Damn it! Let me out of here, you stupid little brat!
Now you've shown your true colors.
Tacks? I can't see, but I appear to be on the post right now.
I've got a great idea!
Your tacks helped me come up with a trump card to get out of here!
It's easy! It's all thanks to you!
Well, see ya!
Wha...
Hey, you bastard...
Say something, damn it!
O-Okuyasu, this isn't good! I think he might have run away!
Jotaro! H-He got away!
I-It's my fault. H-He used the tacks and did something!
You've been fooled, you moron!
Looks like I've won the battle of wits.
What?!
Th-This is...
What's this doing here?
It can't be!
It's the bow and arrow... But we retrieved them...
The bow and arrow should be in safekeeping at the Speedwagon Foundation...
Is there another set?
Josuke, be careful! Kira's father escaped!
What?!
This arrow drew Deadly Queen out of Yoshikage!
The arrow is the important part!
I'll never let you have it!
R-Reverb, Koichi! Use Act 1 to go after it!
I-It's too far away!
Seriously?
D-Damn it! It's all my fault!
No, Okuyasu. He was just a stronger opponent.
You can tell that Kira is definitely his son.
We've lost to that family's determination
As long as they don't get this arrow, that's good enough.
I'm going to use this to make more enemies for you!
The bow and arrow, huh... I see.
I thought there might be more than one set.
Now I know exactly how DIO and the others
They created more of them around the world
Because Stand users attract other Stand users, apparently.
Yoshikage, where are you right now?
You never could help but kill women, even when you were a boy.
But if that's what brings you happiness, I'll protect you.
Because...
You're my one and only son.
Kosaku Kawajiri Shinobu Hayato
What's gotten into you? You're actually cooking?
I-I mean, I didn't know you even knew how.
Two plates? This one's for me?
You're telling me to eat your cooking?
Hey! Cut your nails later!
And didn't you cut them last night?
Oh... Th-This is actually really good...

Kitty!
Why?
Hey! What gives you the right to shut the window near the tree?!
I've told you day after day not to shut it!
What's wrong, kitty? Why are you so worked up?
Cats hate water.
I'm sorry about that. I shut the window without thinking.
I won't do it again.
Something's wrong. He's changed somehow.
and he's using an actual blade rather than an electric razor to shave.
Blades always give him razor burn...
Hey, you haven't paid your rent from last month.
It's now 260,000 yen including this month's.
Pay up right now!
Rent?
You heard him. Hurry up and bring it from the safe.
Safe?
Hurry! You're the only one who knows the combination to the safe!
Hey, what are you...
Thank you for coming so early in the morning, sir.
But I seem to be a bit short on cash right now.
Huh?
Quit screwing around!
You got in over your head when
You need to learn to live within your means!
Um, we'll get it right away—
No. Please don't get the wrong idea.
When I said I was a bit short, look.
Will that suffice?
Y-Yes, that's plenty.
Thank you very much.
Pleasure doing business with you!
Y-You...
You must have stolen that money from the landlord.
But my husband's actions... him stealing that...
I think he's so romantic...
